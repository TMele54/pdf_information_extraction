Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 35 (VPS35) is involved in retrograde transport of proteins from endosomes to trans-
Golgi network. Gene mutations in VPS35 are linked to autosomal dominant late-onset Parkinson’s disease (PD). Although the
identification of VPS35 mutations has provided novel insight about its interactions with several PD-associated genes including
leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) and α-synuclein, little information is available about the molecular mechanisms of cell death
downstream of VPS35 dysfunction. In this study, we showed that VPS35 has a role in the lysosomal degradation of parkin
substrate aminoacyl tRNA synthetase complex-interacting multifunctional protein 2 (AIMP2), of which accumulation leads to poly
(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1)-dependent cell death. VPS35 was co-immunoprecipitated with AIMP2, as well as lysosome-
associated membrane protein-2a (Lamp2a). Interestingly, this association was disrupted by PD-associated VPS35 mutant D620N.
VPS35 overexpression prevented AIMP2-potentiated cell death and PARP1 activation in SH-SY5Y cells. More importantly,
knockdown of VPS35 led to PARP1 activation and cell death, which was AIMP2 dependent. These findings provide new
mechanistic insights into the role of VPS35 in the regulation of AIMP2 levels and cell death. As AIMP2 accumulation was reported
in PD patient’s brains and involved in dopaminergic cell death, identification of VPS35 as a novel regulator of AIMP2 clearance via
lysosomal pathway provides alternative venue to control dopaminergic cell death in PD.

Degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons contributes to
cardinal motor deficits in Parkinson’s disease (PD). PD-linked
mutations in several genes (parkin, α-synuclein, PINK1, DJ-1,
LRRK2 and vacuolar protein sorting-35 (VPS35)) have been
reported, providing clues to the molecular mechanisms involved
in dopaminergic neuronal dysfunction or demise in PD
patients.1–5 Parkin is an E3 ubiquitin ligase whose mutations
or phosphorylation by stress-activated kinase c-Abl inhibits its
ligase activity and neuroprotective function in dopaminergic
neurons.2 Accumulation of parkin substrates is responsible for
PD-associated pathological changes downstream of parkin
inactivation.6–8 For example, parkin-interacting substrate
(PARIS) can lead to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
gamma coactivator 1-alpha repression and defects in antiox-
idant defense in PD animal models.6 Accumulation of Pael
receptor, another parkin substrate, can increase endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress, which is associated with pathological
changes in PD.8 Recently, more direct link of PD to dopaminer-
gic cell death downstream of parkin inactivation has been
tRNA synthetase complex-interacting
reported. Aminoacyl
multifunctional protein 2 (AIMP2)
is a pathogenic parkin
substrate that accumulates in animal models of parkin

inactivation and postmortem PD patient brains.9,10 Conditional
transgenic mouse expressing AIMP2 in brains has revealed that
AIMP2 accumulation alone is sufficient
for age-dependent
and -selective dopaminergic neurodegeneration.10 Importantly,
nuclear translocation of AIMP2 and interaction with the nuclear
enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) lead to over-
production of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) that is responsible for
PAR-dependent cell death (parthanatos).10 As PAR-dependent
cell death because of AIMP2 accumulation seems to be
involved in dopaminergic loss in PD, it would be important to
understand the molecular mechanisms underlying AIMP2
clearance to prevent progressive neurodegeneration in PD.

As a lysine 48 (K48) ubiquitin substrate of parkin, AIMP2 is
polyubiquitinated and targeted to the proteasome for
degradation.9–12 Thus, MG132 inhibition of proteasome
results in the elevation of AIMP2 protein levels. Interestingly,
previous study has also shown that both lysosomal inhibition
and proteasome inhibition have hampered AIMP2 degradation
to some extent,12 suggesting that AIMP2, in addition to parkin-
mediated proteasomal degradation, could be regulated
through lysosomal degradation by yet unknown molecular
pathway.

Role of VPS35 on AIMP2-regulated cell toxicity
SP Yun et al

Autosomal dominant mutations in VPS35 have been
recently identified by exome sequencing. They are respon-
sible for late-onset PD in multi-incidence families.13,14 Clinical
manifestation in PD patients with VPS35 mutations is quite

similar to sporadic PD cases with late-onset motor symptoms,
including Lewy body pathology and good L-DOPA respon-
siveness.14 VPS35 is a component of retromer complex
that functions in endosome-to-golgi retrieval of membrane

proteins, endosomal recycle and others.15–17 Interestingly,
VPS35 downregulation is clinically associated with neurode-
generative diseases including PD and Alzheimer’s disease
(AD).18,19 Consistent with this notion, VPS35 ablation in
dopaminergic neurons results in PD-associated deficits in
mice, such as α-synuclein accumulation, loss of dopamine
impairment.20,21 Absence of VPS35
neurons and motor
renders yeast more vulnerable to protein aggregation-
induced toxicity by eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4
gamma 1 (EIF4G1) overexpression.22 Conversely, overex-
pression of WT VPS35 rescues locomotor deficits and
reduction of lifespan in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2)
transgenic PD fly models.23 VPS35 also protects neurons
toxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium
against mitochondrial
(MPP+)-induced oxidative stress.24 Dysfunction of VPS35 by
reduction of
its expression levels or PD-linked mutations
results in abnormal recycling or subcellular targeting of its
substrates.17,20,25 For
instance, VPS35 deficits lead to
abnormal delivery of lysosome proteases because of defec-
tive targeting of cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate
receptor, a cargo of VPS35/retromer.17,25 It has also been
shown that impaired endosome-to-golgi retrieval of lysosome-
associated membrane glycoprotein-2a (Lamp2a) is respon-
sible for lysosomal degradation of available Lamp2a pool in
dopamine neurons of VPS35 deletion.20 As Lamp2a mediates
α-synuclein degradation via chaperone-mediated autophagy
(CMA), downregulation of lamp2a following VPS35 deficits
can lead to accumulation of α-synuclein.20

Here, we identified VPS35 as a novel regulator of AIMP2 by
lysosomal clearance. VPS35 overexpression reduced endo-
genous AIMP2 levels and prevented AIMP2 accumulation.
VPS35 interacted with AIMP2 via Lamp2a, suggesting CMA-
mediated degradation of AIMP2. VPS35 knockdown resulted
in AIMP2 accumulation and sensitized cells to parthanatic cell
death. Our data indicated that accumulation of AIMP2 in
VPS35 dysfunction could contribute to dopaminergic cell
toxicity in PD. Our finding also provided a novel pathway of
AIMP2 degradation that could be used to control AIMP2
accumulation and dopaminergic cell death in PD.

Results

VPS35 facilitates AIMP2 degradation via lysosome.
AIMP2 accumulation is strongly associated with dopaminer-
gic cell death in PD.9–12 To identify the potential role of VPS35

in regulating pathogenic parkin substrate AIMP2, we per-
formed a small-scale screening in SH-SY5Y cells transiently
transfected with V5-WT VSP35 or the PD-linked mutant
version V5-D620N VPS35. Overexpression of WT VPS35
reduced endogenous AIMP2 levels (Figures 1a and b).
However, overexpression of D620N VPS35 increased the
endogenous levels of AIMP2 (Figures 1a and b). Alteration
of AIMP2 expression by VPS35 was not mediated by the
E3 ubiquitin ligase parkin because VPS35 did not affect
endogenous parkin expression levels (Figures 1a and b).
Moreover, AIMP2 mRNA level did not change by the
overexpression of either WT or D620N VPS35 (Figure 1c),
indicating that VPS35 regulates AIMP2 via mechanisms
transcription. To further determine the
downstream of
degradation rate of endogenous AIMP2 by VPS35 over-
expression, endogenous AIMP2 levels were monitored over
time after treatment with cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein
biosynthesis. Overexpression of WT VPS35 accelerated the
degradation of AIMP2. However, AIMP2 clearance was
inhibited by overexpression of D620N VPS35 (Figures 1d
and e).

Next, we sought to determine how VPS35 facilitated AIMP2
clearance by using pharmacological
inhibitors of either
proteasome or lysosome. Consistent with previous reports,
both proteasome inhibitor MG132 and lysosome inhibitors
Pepstatin A1 and E64D resulted in accumulation of steady-
state levels of endogenous AIMP2 (Figures 1f and g). These
results indicate that AIMP2 clearance is mediated by both
proteasome and lysosome degradation pathways. Interest-
ingly, treatment with lysosomal
inhibitor Pepstatin A1 and
E64D completely blocked the accelerated degradation of
AIMP2 by VPS35 overexpression, whereas MG132 treatment
failed to reverse the effect of VPS35 on AIMP2 degradation
(Figures 1f and g). Consistent with the notion that VPS35
influences lysosomal AIMP2 degradation, another lysosome
inhibitor NH4Cl also blocked the effect of VPS35 on AIMP2
degradation (Supplementary Figures S1a and b). On the other
hand, AIMP2 did not appear to affect VPS35 function as
endogenous VPS35 levels were not altered by AIMP2 over-
expression (Supplementary Figures S2a and b).

Lysosomal degradation pathways include macroautophagy
and CMA.26 To determine which autophagic pathway is
involved in AIMP2 degradation, SH-SY5Y cells were trans-
fected with V5-VPS35 and AIMP2 stability was monitored
when macroautophagy was blocked by 3-methyladenine
(3-MA) treatment. Inhibition of macroautophagy had no effect

on AIMP2 degradation and Lamp2a stabilization that were
facilitated by VPS35 expression (Figures 1h and i). Taken
together, these findings indicate that VPS35 is involved in the
regulation of AIMP2 expression possibly through the CMA
pathway.

AIMP2 interacts with VPS35. VPS35 is the central largest
retromer complex assembled with the other
subunit of
subunits including VPS26 and VPS29.14,27 This trimer
decides target protein recycling and degradation through
target cargo binding.14,27 To determine potential association
of VPS35 and AIMP2, SH-SY5Y extracts were fractionated
by gel filtration chromatography. Our results revealed that
AIMP2, especially those in high molecular weight fractions,
shared similar fractional location (fractions 2–8) with VPS35
(Figure 2a). We further characterized the interaction between
VPS35 and AIMP2 by co-immunoprecipitation using SH-
SY5Y cells transfected with FLAG-AIMP2 and V5-WT VPS35
or V5-D620N VPS35. Co-immunoprecipitation using antibody
to V5 revealed that AIMP2 was strongly associated with
V5-WT VPS35 (Figures 2b and d). Immunoprecipitation of
V5-VPS35 also pulled down endogenous Lamp2a, a receptor
for CMA degradation of aggregation-prone protein substrate.
Consistent with previous report,20 WT VPS35 expression
stabilized endogenous Lamp2a, whereas D620N VPS35
leading to reduction of
impaired Lamp2a recycling,

endogenous Lamp2a levels (Figures 2b and c). Mutant
VPS35 expression was also correlated with its impaired
association with AIMP2 and accumulation of AIMP2 when
compared with WT VPS35 expression or mock DNA control
transfection (Figures 2b and c). Finally, endogenously
expressed VPS35 were colocalized with AIMP2 and Lamp2a
in SH-SY5Y cells after co-labeling each protein (Figure 2e).
Consistent with the immunoblot analysis (Figures 2b and c),
WT VPS35 expression led to marked reduction of AIMP2
signals, whereas D620N mutant expression resulted in
AIMP2 accumulation and even infiltration into the nucleus.
Taken together, these results suggest that VPS35 may be
associated with AIMP2 via Lamp2a and thereby regulating
the stability of Lamp2a and the clearance of AIMP2 via
lysosomal/autophagic pathway.

VPS35 regulates AIMP2-induced cell death. Previously,
we had shown that AIMP2 accumulation in SH-SY5Y cells or
dopaminergic neurons in vivo is sufficient to cause cell death
via PARP1 activation.10 As VPS35 overexpression reduced
AIMP2 accumulation via lysosomal degradation, we hypothe-
sized that overexpression of WT VPS35 could have
protective effect against AIMP2-induced cell death, whereas
D620N VPS35 may increase cell susceptibility to AIMP2
toxicity. To determine whether VPS35 can alter cell death in
SH-SY5Y cells, we monitored cell viability by using two

independent assays: alamarBlue assay and lactate dehydro-
genase (LDH) release assay. Both assays demonstrated that
cell death was increased when D620N VPS35 mutant was
overexpressed (Figures 3a and b) where endogenous AIMP2
accumulation was also observed (Figures 1a and b).

ability of VPS35 expression in suppressing AIMP2 toxicity in
the background of oxidative stress induced by hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2). Similarly, cell death in response to H2O2 was
monitored by using alamarBlue and LDH release assays in
SH-SY5Y cells expressing mock or FLAG-AIMP2 together
with WT or D620N VPS35. H2O2 treatment substantially
increased cell death in both assays. AIMP2 expression further
enhanced this toxicity (Figures 3c and d). Importantly, over-
expression of WT VPS35 significantly ameliorated AIMP2
and/or H2O2-induced cell death, whereas overexpression of
D620N VPS35 resulted in more cell death induced by
AIMP2 and/or H2O2 (Figures 3c and d). These data together
indicate that VPS35 expression protects SH-SY5Y cells
from AIMP2- and oxidative stress-induced cell death, suggest-
ing a potential
therapeutic application of VPS35 in PD
pathogenesis involving AIMP2 accumulation with or without
oxidative stress.

VPS35 regulates AIMP2 activation of PARP1. AIMP2
accumulation can lead to dopaminergic cell death via nuclear
translocation and subsequent binding to PARP1, resulting in
PARP1 activation and PAR elevation, which mediate partha-
natic cell death.10 To assess whether VPS35 can regulate
PARP1 activation and PAR production by AIMP2, levels of
PARsylated proteins were monitored by western blot using
anti-PAR antibody. SH-SY5Y cells expressing FLAG-AIMP2
or mock as a control were subsequently challenged with
H2O2 treatment. WT or D620N VPS35 was coexpressed to
determine whether VPS35 could modulate PAR activation
induced by AIMP2 and/or oxidative stress. PAR immunoblot
analysis revealed that overexpression of D620N VPS35
mutant increased PARP1 activation compared with mock or
WT VPS35 overexpression (Figures 4a and b). Elevation of
PARsylated protein levels induced by FLAG-AIMP2 was
reduced to basal
levels by WT VPS35 coexpression.
However, coexpression of D620N VPS35 further enhanced
AIMP2-mediated activation of PARP1 (Figures 4a and b).
VPS35 regulation of AIMP2-induced PARP1 activation was
more evident in SH-SY5Y cells following H2O2 treatment that
further increased the levels of PARsylated proteins. WT
VSP35 mitigated AIMP2 enhancement of PARP1 activation in
the background of H2O2 treatment compared with mock or
D620N VPS35 mutant
transfection with H2O2 treatment
(Figures 4a and b).

PARP1 activation results from its interaction with AIMP2 in
the nucleus.10 Therefore, we monitored subcellular distribu-
tion of AIMP2 and its interaction with PARP1 in response to
VPS35 expression. Consistent with the notion that AIMP2

levels are reduced by VPS35, overexpression of WT VPS35
inhibited the binding of AIMP2 to PARP1 (Figures 4c-e) and
reduced AIMP2 distribution to the nucleus fraction (Figures 4f
and g). In contrast, overexpression of D620N VPS35 that
resulted in more accumulation of AIMP2 enhanced the
association of AIMP2 with PARP1 (Figures 4c-e) and
increased AIMP2 expression in the nucleus fraction
(Figures 4f and g). Taken together, these results suggest that
VPS35 can modulate PARP1 activation by accelerating
thus preventing AIMP2 from nuclear
AIMP2 clearance,
translocation or interaction with PARP1.

Physiological role of VPS35 in AIMP2 clearance. To
determine whether endogenous VPS35 was involved in the
process of AIMP2 turnover, we depleted VPS35 in SH-SY5Y
cells by transiently transfecting shRNA to VPS35. VPS35
reduction by shRNA resulted in a significant
increase of
AIMP2 levels without affecting parkin expression (Figures 5a
and b), supporting the role of endogenous VPS35 in the
clearance of AIMP2. Moreover, ablation of VPS35 by shRNA
reduced Lamp2a expression (Figures 5c and d). There was a
reduction in association between AIMP2 and Lamp2a
(Figures 5c and e). Supporting the notion that VPS35 is
associated with AIMP2 under physiological condition, endo-
genously expressed VPS35 and AIMP2 colocalized in SH-
SY5Y cells after co-labeling each protein (Figure 5f). shRNA-
mediated downregulation of VPS35 resulted in diminished
Lamp2a, enhanced AIMP2 signals and marked translocation
of AIMP2 into the nucleus, indicating defective recycling of
Lamp2a and inefficient clearance of AIMP2 (Figure 5f).

AIMP2 accumulation downstream of VPS35 dysfunction
has a role in cell toxicity. As VPS35 functions in the
clearance of AIMP2 under physiological condition, we sought
to determine whether VPS35 dysfunction could affect PARP1
activation and cell death via AIMP2 accumulation. Supporting
the protective role of VPS35 reported in previous
studies,22–24 knockdown of VPS35 by shRNA resulted in an
increase of cell death as assessed by alamarBlue and LDH
release assays (Figures 6a and b). Cell death induced by
VPS35 ablation was partially prevented by AIMP2 knock-
indicating that
down through shRNA (Figures 6a and b),
AIMP2 mediates cell toxicity downstream of VPS35 deletion.
The extent of cell protection rendered by AIMP down-
regulation was comparable to that of PARP inhibitor,
ABT888 (Figures 6a and b). Moreover, enhancement of cell
toxicity by H2O2 in the background of VPS35 knockdown was
also attenuated by AIMP2 downregulation by shRNA or

PARP inhibitor ABT888 (Figures 6c and d). PAR immunoblot
analysis further
revealed that downregulation of VPS35
increased H2O2-induced PAR activation that was largely
blocked by AIMP2 shRNA or PAPR1 inhibitor (Figures 6e
and f). Taken together, these results indicate that cell toxicity
and PARP1 activation because of VPS35 deficiency is
mediated by AIMP2 accumulation.

Discussion
In this study, for the first time, we report that a retromer
component VPS35 is associated with AIMP2 and that VPS35
regulates lysosomal degradation of AIMP2. Co-immuno-
precipitation of VPS35 with AIMP2 and Lamp2a indicates that
they are mutually associated with each other in the endosomal
trafficking pathway. Based on previous report that Lamp2a

stability is regulated by VPS35,20 it appears that VPS35/
retromer can sort Lamp2a for recycling to the Golgi network. In
lysosomes, Lamp2a tunnels lysosomal transport and degra-
dation of misfolded proteins via CMA.30,31 The identification of
Lamp2a in association with AIMP2 suggests that misfolded
AIMP2 could be degraded via the lysosomal pathway
(Figure 7). Consistent with this notion and a previous
report,12 lysosomal
inhibitors blocked AIMP2 degradation
facilitated by VPS35 overexpression. It is important to note
that AIMP2 is found in Lewy body in association with α-
synuclein in the brains of PD patient.11,12 This indicates that
AIMP2 is an aggregation-prone protein.32 In the brains of PD
patients, parkin activity is compromised, leading to accumula-
tion of its substrate proteins including AIMP2.9,11,12,33 Under
this condition, the activity of VPS35 could be critical to prevent
abnormal accumulation of AIMP2 and its co-aggregation with
α-synuclein.

It

AIMP2 stability was mainly assessed in a transient
transfection setting because of the fact that prolonged and
constitutive expression of mutant VPS35 in a stable cell line
may lead to cellular toxicity. Nevertheless, further experiments
using stable cell
lines of VPS35 expression or knockdown
would provide additional insight on VPS35-AIMP2 pathways
by excluding potential variation in protein expression caused
by transient transfection.
is possible that

the interaction between AIMP2 and
VPS35 can affect the functions of VPS35/retromer. VPS35
dysfunction can lead to lysosomal dysfunction via abnormal
targeting of various lysosomal proteases, thus contributing
to AIMP2 accumulation in response to VPS35 knockdown.
Interestingly, VPS35 knockout can lead to the downregulation
of Lamp2a and the accumulation of α-synuclein.20 α-Synuclein
elevation in turn inhibits CMA-mediated misfolded protein
further exacerbating α-synuclein accumu-
degradation,
lation. This indicates that there is a reciprocal regulation and
vicious cycle of α-synuclein/VPS35 pathology. Further
studies are needed to determine the potential reciprocal
regulation of VPS35 by AIMP2, although we did not observe
any alterations in VPS35 expression when AIMP2 levels were
increased.

AIMP2 expression can lead to PARP1 activation and
dopaminergic neurodegeneration in mice.10 In this study,
abnormal elevation of AIMP2 protein because of VPS35
deficiency resulted in its marked nuclear translocation and
increased interaction with PARP1. This interaction stimulates
PAR synthesis whose overproduction is responsible for
parthanatic cell death.10 Given that AIMP2 levels are critical
determinant of PARP1 activation and cell toxicity, modulating

AIMP2 degradation pathway could be used as a potential
strategy to prevent pathological consequences because of
AIMP2 elevation (Figure 7). In this study, we showed that
VPS35 overexpression accelerated AIMP2 degradation.
Consistent with the role of AIMP2 in mediating cell toxicity,
we showed that coexpression of WT VPS35 but not mutant
VPS35 prevented cell toxicity caused by elevated AIMP2 in
SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line.

accumulation

and AIMP2-related

Downregulation of VPS35 resulted in the accumulation of
AIMP2, suggesting that endogenous VPS35 was also
involved in keeping optimal AIMP2 protein levels. It is likely
that parkin and VPS35 function in separate degradation
pathways to control endogenous AIMP2 expression whose
in cell survival.
dysregulation is pathologically detrimental
Consistent with this notion, downregulation of VPS35 sensi-
tized SH-SY5Y cells to parthanatic cell death caused by
AIMP2 accumulation.
It has been reported that VPS35
expression is decreased in the brains of AD and PD
patients.18,19
Indeed, expression of PD-linked mutant
VPS35 (D620N) led to similar effects to VPS35 knockdown
on AIMP2
cellular
toxicity. Although it is controversial regarding the mode of
action by D620N mutation in VPS35,17,22,34 our data support
the notion that D620N VPS35 is a dominant-negative mutation
especially on endosomal recycling of Lamp2a and regulation
of AIMP2 stability. AIMP2 accumulation has been seen in
degenerating ventral midbrains of postmortem PD brains.9–12
Both parkin inactivation and VPS35 dysfunction could
have contributed to the highly variable accumulation of AIMP2
in pathologically inflicted PD patients’ brains. Considering
well-accepted pathological
role of protein aggregation
and extensive association of VPS35 with other PD genes,
VPS35 loss-of-function may be involved in the regulation of
many pathological processes in PD. AIMP2 regulation by
VPS35 could be an additional critical process especially
relevant to dopaminergic cell death in PD. Therefore, prevent-
ing AIMP2-mediated PARP1 activation by modulating VPS35
function could be used as a potential therapeutic strategy
for PD.

Given the fact that AIMP2 accumulation is found in both
sporadic PD and genetic PD with parkin mutations, identifica-
tion of alternative route of AIMP2 clearance is meaningful in
that it provides additional pathway to prevent pathological
AIMP2 accumulation. Pharmacological chaperone has been
successfully developed to stabilize VPS35/retromer complex,
thereby limiting amyloid precursor protein processing.35
As VPS35 reduction is also implicated in PD,13,21 such
stabilizer could prevent AIMP2 accumulation induced by

VPS dysfunction and parkin inactivation. In addition to VPS35,
parkin induction could prevent AIMP2 accumulation. Recently,
it has been reported that diaminodiphenyl sulfone treatment
can induce parkin expression via mild oxidative stress.36 It

would be interesting to test these chemicals in animal models
of AIMP2 accumulation to determine whether dopaminergic

a synergistic manner.

Cell culture and transfection. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells
(ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS (vol/vol)
and antibiotics in a humidified 5% CO2/95% air atmosphere at 37 °C. For transient
transfection, cells were transfected with indicated target vectors using Lipofectamine
and Plus reagents (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Unless
otherwise indicated, lysates were prepared at 48 h after transfection.

Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Total RNA was extracted
from cells with RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA). cDNA was
synthesized from total RNA (1.5 μg) using a First-strand cDNA synthesis kit
(Invitrogen). Aliquots of cDNA were used as templates for real-time qRT-PCR.
Relative quantities of mRNA expression levels were analyzed using real-time PCR
(Applied Biosystems ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System, Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). SYBR green ER reagent (Invitrogen) was used
according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The primer sequences for real-time
PCR were: AIMP2-F, 5′-AGGTAAAGCCCTATCACGGG-3′; AIMP2-R, 5′-ACAGGTT
AGACTCTTCCTGCAC-3′; GAPDH-F, 5′-TGTTTGTGATGGGTGTGAAC-3′; GAP
DH-R, 5′-TACTTGGCAGGTTTCTCCAG-3′. Real-time PCR conditions were:
denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, 30 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing temperature
(Tm) 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, followed by 5 min of extension at 72 °C.
When the melting Tm was reached, double-stranded DNA was denatured and the
SYBR was released, causing a marked decrease in fluorescence intensity. The rate
of this change was determined by plotting the derivative of the fluorescence relative
to the Tm (dF/dT) versus Tm using data analysis software provided by the real-time
PCR instrument. The Tm at which a peak occurred on the plot corresponded to the

Gel filtration chromatography. Soluble protein extracts form SH-SY5Y
cells were prepared in buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mM
EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM mercaptoethanol, 5 mM ATP plus a cocktail of
inhibitors). Gel filtration chromatography was performed with a Superose-6 column
by FPLC (GE Healthcare UK Ltd. Buckinghamshire, UK). The column was
equilibrated with two column volumes of buffer A. One milliliter of each fraction
(32 ml
in total) was separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% gels. Fractionated proteins
were detected with AIMP2, and VPS35 antibodies.

Co-immunoprecipitation. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, at 48 h
post
transfection, SH-SY5Y cells were washed with cold PBS and harvested in
immunoprecipitation buffer (1% NP-40, 2 mg per ml aprotinin and 100 mg per ml
PMSF in PBS). The lysate was then rotated at 4 °C for 1 h followed by centrifugation
at 22 250 × g for 20 min. The supernatants were then combined with protein G
Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) pre-incubated with
antibodies against FLAG or V5 or VPS35 and mixed by rotating at 4 °C overnight.
Protein G Sepharose was pelleted and washed twice with immunoprecipitation buffer
followed by twice wash with 500 mM NaCl buffer. The precipitates were resolved on
SDS-PAGE gels and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Immunoblot signals were
visualized with chemiluminescence (Pierce, Rockford,
IL, USA). Densitometric
analyses of immunoreactive bands were performed using Image J software (NIH,
Bethesda, MD, USA, http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/).

Western blot analysis. Cells were harvested, washed twice with PBS and
lysed with Pierce RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1% NP-40, 1%
SDS and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate plus protease inhibitor mixture, Thermo
Scientific) for 30 min on ice. Cell
lysates were then prepared by centrifugation
(22 250 × g at 4 °C for 20 min). Protein concentration was determined using Pierce
BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific). Equal amounts of protein (10–20 μg)
were resolved on 8–16 % SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane.
After washing with TBST (Tris-buffer solution-Tween-20) (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6),
150 mM NaCl and 0.05% Tween-20), the membranes were blocked with 5 % skim
milk for 1 h and incubated with an appropriate primary antibody at
the dilution
recommended by the supplier. The membrane was then washed and primary
antibodies were detected with a HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. Immunoblot
signals were visualized with chemiluminescence (Pierce). Densitometric analyses of
the immunoreactive bands were performed using NIH Image J software. The ratios
between each treated- and control samples were calculated for each individual
experiment and expressed as a percentage compared with the control.

Figure 7 Schematic diagram illustrating AIMP2 clearance facilitated by VPS35-
Lamp2a pathway. In PD condition where VPS35 function is compromised by its
mutations or downregulation, Lamp2a recycling is impaired,
leading to AIMP2
accumulation. High levels of AIMP2, in turn, lead to its nuclear translocation and
thereby PARP1 activation causing PARP1-dependent cell death (parthanatos)

SP Yun et al

Subcellular fractionation . Harvested cell pellet was mixed with buffer 1
(250 mM sucrose, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM MgCl2) in the presence of Halt protease
inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific) and incubated for 10 min on an end-over-end
shaker
followed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants
containing cytosolic protein were transferred to cold tubes on ice. The pellet was
suspended in buffer 2 (1 M sucrose, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM MgCl2) containing
protease inhibitor cocktail and incubated on an end-over-end shaker for 30 min
followed by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 10 min. The new supernatants containing
membrane proteins were transferred to cold tubes on ice. The remaining pellet was
suspended in buffer 3 (20 mM Tris-HCl, 0.4 M NaCl, 15 % glycerol, 1.5 % Triton
X-100) containing protease inhibitor cocktail and incubated on an end-over-end
shaker for 10 min. The supernatants containing nuclear proteins were collected
after centrifugation at 6800 × g for 10 min.

Pulse chase analysis. For pulse chase studies, SH-SY5Y cells were
transiently transfected with plasmids as indicated. At 48 h after transfection, cells
were treated with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein biosynthesis.
Cells were harvested at different time point as indicated. Cells were then lyses with
RIPA lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1% NP-40, 1% SDS, and 0.5
% sodium deoxycholate plus protease inhibitor mixture). Protein concentration of
each sample was determined using BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific).
These samples were then subjected to western blot analysis. Densitometric
analyses of immunoreactive bands were performed using NIH Image J software.
Proteins levels were normalized to β-actin.

Immunofluorescence. SH-SY5Y cells were plated onto poly-D-lysine-coated
coverslips at 10 000 cells/cm.2 Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS
and blocked in a solution containing 5% normal donkey serum (Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA, USA), 2% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich),
and 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at room Tm. Samples were then
incubated with primary antibodies against AIMP2, VPS35 or Lamp2a at 4 °C
overnight. Briefly, cells grown on coverslips were washed with PBS containing 0.1%
Triton X-100 and incubated with anti-rabbit Alexa-488, anti-goat Alexa-568 and anti-
mouse Alexa-647 antibodies (1:250, Thermo Scientific) at room Tm for 1 h. The
coverslips were mounted with DAPI. Fluorescent images were obtained using a
confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, LSM 710, Thornwood, NY, USA).

Cell viability assays. Cell viability was tested with two methods: alamarBlue
assay (Invitrogen) and LDH assay (Sigma-Aldrich). Cell death was assessed
through alamarBlue assay according to the manufacturer’s protocol. LDH activity in
culture medium representing relative cell viability and membrane integrity was
following the
kit
measured using the LDH assay
manufacturer’s instructions.

Statistics. Data are presented as mean ± S.E.M. with at least three independent
experiments. Representative morphological images were taken out of at least three
experiments with parallel results. Unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test or analysis of
variance (ANOVA) test followed by Bonferroni post-hoc analysis was used to assess
statistical significance. Assessments with P-value o0.05 were considered as
statistically significant.
