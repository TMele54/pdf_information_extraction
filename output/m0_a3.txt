ABSTRACT
Inﬂuenza A viruses (IAVs) rely on host factors to support their life cycle, as viral proteins hijack or interact with cellular proteins
to execute their functions. Identiﬁcation and understanding of these factors would increase our knowledge of the molecular
mechanisms manipulated by the viruses. In this study, we searched for novel binding partners of the inﬂuenza A virus NS2 pro-
tein, the nuclear export protein responsible for overcoming host range restriction, by a yeast two-hybrid screening assay and
glutathione S-transferase-pulldown and coimmunoprecipitation assays and identiﬁed AIMP2, a potent tumor suppressor that
usually functions to regulate protein stability, as one of the major NS2-binding candidates. We found that the presence of NS2
protected AIMP2 from ubiquitin-mediated degradation in NS2-transfected cells and AIMP2 functioned as a positive regulator of
IAV replication. Interestingly, AIMP2 had no signiﬁcant effect on NS2 but enhanced the stability of the matrix protein M1. Fur-
ther, we provide evidence that AIMP2 recruitment switches the modiﬁcation of M1 from ubiquitination to SUMOylation, which
occurs on the same attachment site (K242) on M1 and thereby promotes M1-mediated viral ribonucleoprotein complex nuclear
export to increase viral replication. Collectively, our results reveal a new mechanism of AIMP2 mediation of inﬂuenza virus rep-
lication.

IMPORTANCE
Although the ubiquitination of M1 during IAV infection has been observed, the precise modiﬁcation site and the molecular con-
sequences of this modiﬁcation remain obscure. Here, we demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that ubiquitin and SUMO compete for
the same lysine (K242) on M1 and the interaction of NS2 with AIMP2 facilitates the switch of the M1 modiﬁcation from ubiquiti-
nation to SUMOylation, thus increasing viral replication.

Inﬂuenza A virus (IAV) is a signiﬁcant cause of morbidity and

mortality in both humans and animal species owing to its ability
to cause yearly epidemics and occasional pandemics (1–3). Like
other viruses, IAV hijacks the host cellular machinery to support
its life cycle. Thus, identiﬁcation and characterization of the inter-
actions between viral components and speciﬁc host factors would
help provide an understanding of the mechanisms by which the
viruses acquire human pandemic potential.

IAV belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family, and its genome
consists of eight negative-sense RNA segments encoding up to 17
viral proteins (4–9). The viral RNA (vRNA) exists as a form of viral
ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs) containing vRNA, nucleo-
protein (NP), and three viral polymerase proteins (PB1, PB2, and
PA). Unlike most other RNA viruses, inﬂuenza virus transcribes
and replicates its genome in the nucleus. Thus, after it enters a host
cell, vRNPs enter the nucleus to complete transcription and rep-
lication (10). The newly synthesized vRNPs are exported from the
nucleus for packaging into progeny virions (11). In this regard,
efﬁcient nuclear export of vRNPs is essential for productive infec-
tion.

NS2, also known as nuclear export protein (NEP), acts as an
adaptor to mediate the nuclear export of vRNPs by forming the
Crm1-NS2-M1-vRNP complex (12, 13). Recently, this adaptor
protein has been shown to play an important role in overcoming

host range restriction. Adaptive mutations in NS2 can increase
viral RNA accumulation, which compensates for the reduced ac-
tivity of avian viral polymerase in mammalian cells, thereby allow-
ing highly pathogenic avian H5N1 inﬂuenza viruses to overcome
host restriction (14). It has also been reported that NS2 promotes
the efﬁcient release of budding virions by recruiting F1Fo ATPase
(15). Consequently, NS2 appears to perform different functions
during the viral life cycle.

M1, another key regulator of vRNP nuclear export (11, 16), is a
multifunctional protein that plays essential structural and func-

tional roles in various steps of the inﬂuenza virus life cycle. The
proper subcellular localization of M1 is necessary for its functions
in the viral life cycle. Early in infection, newly synthesized M1
translocates to the nucleus, where it blocks the transcription of
viral mRNA by binding to vRNPs and mediates vRNP nuclear
export (16–19). Late in infection, M1 is exported from the nucleus
to block the reentry of vRNPs into the nucleus, mediate viral as-
sembly and budding, and control virus morphology (11, 20–22).
Posttranslational modiﬁcations of M1 play important roles in the
regulation of its cellular localization and function. Phosphoryla-
tion of M1 at Y132 mediates the nuclear import of M1 (23),
whereas SUMOylation of M1 regulates the nuclear export of
vRNPs and promotes virion assembly and budding (21). Ubiq-
uitination of M1 has been implicated in IAV release from the
endosomes (24). However, the precise modiﬁcation site and the
biological functions of M1 ubiquitination are not well under-
stood.

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase interacting multifunctional pro-
tein 2 (AIMP2; also known as JTV-1 or p38) was ﬁrst identiﬁed to
be a component of the multi-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (ARS)
complex (25, 26). Besides stabilizing the ARS complex to promote
efﬁcient protein synthesis, AIMP2 has recently been shown to dis-
sociate from the ARS complex following DNA damage or onco-
genic stimuli and work as a potent tumor suppressor through the
regulation of ubiquitin-mediated degradation of target proteins.
AIMP2 binds to and sequesters p53 from Mdm2-dependent ubiq-
uitination in response to oxidative stress (27). Following trans-
forming growth factor (cid:2) treatment, AIMP2 interacts with and
mediates the ubiquitination of FBP (28). AIMP2 also promotes
tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-(cid:3))-induced ubiquitin-depen-
dent degradation of TRAF2 (29). Moreover, AIMP2 itself is a sub-
strate of the E3 ligase Parkin (30, 31).

In this study, we performed a yeast two-hybrid assay to screen
NS2-interacting host proteins and identiﬁed AIMP2 to be its poten-
tial binding partner. We present data that NS2 interacts with AIMP2
and protects it from ubiquitin-mediated degradation. AIMP2 func-
tions as a positive regulator of IAV replication by facilitating the
switch from ubiquitination to SUMOylation of M1.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture, viruses, and antibodies. A549 (human type II alveolar epi-
thelial), 293T (human embryonic kidney), HeLa (human epithelial carci-
noma) cells, and MDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cells were cul-
tured in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented

Kingdom).

Recombinant inﬂuenza virus A/WSN/33 (H1N1) (WSN) was gener-
ated using a 12-plasmid-based reverse genetics approach and propagated
in MDCK cells (32). A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus was propagated in speciﬁc-
pathogen-free chicken embryos. The viral titer was measured using a stan-
dard plaque assay or hemagglutinin (HA) assay (33, 34). The M1 K242R
mutant virus was generated using reverse genetics in which segment 7
(wild-type [WT] M gene) was replaced with the mutant construct
(AAA ¡ AGA at residue 749).

Mouse antitubulin (catalog number ZS-80350) and anti-His antibodies,
tetramethyl rhodamine isocyanate (TRITC)-conjugated anti-goat IgG,
and TRITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Zhongshan
Golden Bridge Biotechnology (Beijing, China). Fluorescein isothiocya-
nate (FITC)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and FITC-conjugated anti-
mouse IgG were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Rabbit
polyclonal antibody against inﬂuenza A virus NP and mouse monoclonal
anti-inﬂuenza A virus M1 antibody were kindly provided by Wenjun Liu
(Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China).
Plasmids. The NS2 gene was ampliﬁed from inﬂuenza A virus
A/WSN/33 (H1N1) cDNA by PCR and cloned into the pGEX4T-1,
pBridge, pXJ40-HA, pcDNA3.0-Flag, or pcDNA4.0-Myc/His vector. The
NS2 gene of A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) or A/QH/12/05 (H5N1) was cloned into
pXJ40-HA. M1 cDNA was derived from the A/WSN/33 strain and cloned
into the pcDNA3.0-Flag or pcDNA4.0-Myc/His vector. Full-length M1
carrying a K102R, K187R, K230R, or K242R mutation was generated by
PCR with speciﬁc primers and cloned into the pcDNA3.0-Flag or
pcDNA4-Myc/His vector. AIMP2 was cloned into the pGADT7, pXJ40-
HA, pcDNA3.0-Flag, or pcDNA4.0-Myc/His vector. Ubiquitin (Ub)-con-
jugated HA (HA-Ub), HA-K48-Ub, and HA-K63-Ub were kindly pro-
vided by Xin Ye (Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences,
Beijing, China). HA–SUMO-1 was cloned into the pXJ40-HA vector. The
Ubc9 plasmid was kindly provided by Hong Tang (Institute of Biophysics,
Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China). Plasmids for expressing
nontagged PB1, PB2, PA, and NP were derived from an inﬂuenza A virus
reverse genetics system. A polymerase I-expressing plasmid carrying an
inﬂuenza virus-like RNA encoding ﬁreﬂy luciferase (vNS-Luc) was kindly
provided by Xin Ye.

Yeast two-hybrid screening. The GAL4 BD-NS2 fusion bait plasmid
was transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain CG1945 using the
lithium acetate protocol. The transformant was grown on synthetic drop-
out (SD) agar plates without Trp and spread on SD agar plates without His
and Trp for self-activation estimation. The cDNA library derived from
human fetal brain was screened following the Matchmaker two-hybrid
system protocol (Clontech). Approximately 107 Trp(cid:4) Leu(cid:4) transfor-
mants were selected on SD agar plates without His, Leu, and Trp for the
primary screening and then tested by the LacZ assay for the second screen-
ing. After rescue, the potential positive plasmids were isolated and re-
transformed into yeast strain CG1945 containing the NS2 bait plasmid.
Only the clones that were positive for all the reporters and conﬁrmed to be
positive by at least two independent tests were selected for speciﬁc inter-
actions and sequenced.

siRNA oligonucleotide sequences and transfection. The sequences of
small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting AIMP2 (siAIMP2) were as fol-
lows: for siAIMP2 sense, 5=-ACACCAGAUGCAGACUUGAUGUAA-3=;
for siAIMP2 antisense, 5=-UUACAUCAAGUCUGCAUCUGGUGU-3=
(35). The siRNA oligonucleotides were chemically synthesized (Guang-
zhou Ribobio, Guangzhou, China) and transfected into 293T or A549
cells using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according to the manufactur-
er’s instructions (Invitrogen).

Quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Total RNA was isolated from
A/WSN/33 virus-infected cells using the TRIzol reagent (TianGen Biotech
Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). Two-microgram RNA aliquots were used for
ﬁrst-strand cDNA synthesis using Moloney murine leukemia virus re-
verse transcriptase (Promega, USA). The primers used for reverse tran-
scription of vRNA, cRNA, and mRNA were 5=-AGCGAAAGCAGG-3=,
5=-AGTAGAAACAAGG-3=, and oligo(dT), respectively. Real-time PCR
was conducted using SYBR Ex Taq II premix (TaKaRa Co., Ltd., DaLian,
China). The cycle conditions included an initial denaturation step at 95°C
for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of ampliﬁcation for 3 s at 95°C and 1 min at
60°C. The amounts of viral RNA were normalized by the amount of 18S
rRNA. The primer sequences used in the real-time PCR were as follows:
5=-GCCTGCCTGCCTGTGTGTATGGAT-3= for the NP forward primer
and 5=-GGCATGCCATCCACACCAGTTGAC-3= for the NP reverse
primer, 5=-GTAACCCGTTGAACCCCATT-3= for the 18S rRNA forward

verse primer (36), 5=-CCCCAATGTCTCTGTTGTTGAC-3= for the
GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) forward primer

primer; and 5=-ACCTGTCTCTGCAAGCTCTT-3= for the AIMP2 for-
ward primer and 5=-GTGGTTAAAGTCGTGGGCTC-3= for the AIMP2

Luciferase assay. 293T cells were transfected with the IAV PA, PB1,
PB2, and NP expression vectors, along with a luciferase reporter (vNS-
Luc) and the Renilla luciferase reporter vector pRL-TK (Promega, USA),
which was used as an internal control. The cells were also cotransfected
with Flag-AIMP2 and HA-NS2. The cell lysates were prepared at 30 h
posttransfection, and the luciferase activity was measured using a dual-
luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, USA) according to the manu-
facturer’s recommendations. Each set of assays was performed in tripli-
cate.

Western blot analysis. Cell lysates were prepared by washing the
transfected or virus-infected cells with cold phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) and extracting the total protein using cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling
Technology). To detect the cellular localization of inﬂuenza virus pro-
teins, cytoplasmic or nuclear extracts were prepared using a nuclear and
cytoplasmic protein extraction kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology,
Beijing, China). The extracted proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE
and transferred to a polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membrane. After blocking,
the membrane was incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4°C,
followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sec-
ondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. Bands were detected using
enhanced chemiluminescence (Applygen, China).

Immunoﬂuorescence assay. The transfected or A/WSN/33 virus-in-
fected 293T or A549 cells were washed three times with PBS, ﬁxed in 4%
paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, and permeabilized
with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 4 min. After blocking in 5% bovine serum
albumin for 30 min, the cells were incubated for 35 to 40 min with the
primary antibodies at 37°C. After washing with PBS, the cells were incu-
bated for 40 min with TRITC conjugates and ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate
conjugates at 37°C. Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (4=,6-diamidino-
2-phenylindole) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The
cells were observed with a Leica confocal microscope.

GST-pulldown and coimmunoprecipitation assays. Glutathione S-
transferase (GST) and GST fusion proteins were puriﬁed from Esche-
richia coli BL21(DE3) cells using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amer-
sham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). An equal amount of either GST or
GST fusion protein (2 (cid:5)g) bound to the beads was incubated with the
lysates from transiently transfected 293T cells in NP-40 lysis buffer for 4 h
at 4°C. The beads were then washed ﬁve times with PBS containing 0.1%
Triton X-100. The bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 2(cid:6) SDS
loading buffer and analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-HA anti-
body.

For the coimmunoprecipitation experiments, transfected or infected
cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM
HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, protease inhibitors), and the
cell lysates were incubated with antibodies at 4°C for 2 h. Protein G aga-
rose beads (Sigma, USA) were then added, and the mixture was incubated
at 4°C overnight. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer,
boiled in 2(cid:6) SDS loading buffer for 5 min, and then analyzed by Western
blotting.

Statistical analyses. The data are presented as the mean (cid:7) standard
deviation (SD). Statistical comparisons were performed using SPSS (ver-
sion 11.5) software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Parametric data were
compared using Student’s t test. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
was used to determine the difference between independent groups. The
differences between the variants were considered statistically signiﬁcant if
P was (cid:8)0.05.

RESULTS
NS2 interacts with AIMP2 in vitro and in IAV-infected cells. To
better understand the roles of NS2 in the pathogenesis of inﬂuenza
viruses, we performed yeast two-hybrid assays to identify NS2-
binding proteins and obtained four proteins, including AIMP2,
ATP5E, HINT2, and SMC3. Among them, we focused on AIMP2
(Fig. 1A). The interaction between NS2 and AIMP2 was further
conﬁrmed in the in vitro GST-pulldown assay (Fig. 1B) and an in
vivo coimmunoprecipitation study in 293T cells cotransfected
with vectors expressing Flag-tagged AIMP2 and HA-tagged NS2
(Fig. 1C). Next we examined whether endogenous AIMP2 could
interact with NS2 in IAV-infected cells by another coimmunopre-
cipitation study. As shown in Fig. 1D, NS2 could be coimmuno-
precipitated in WSN-infected A549 cell extracts when using a pre-
cipitation antibody to endogenous AIMP2, whereas NS2 was not
detected in the immunoprecipitates by a control IgG. Finally, we
performed immunoﬂuorescence analyses to detect the cellular co-
localization of AIMP2 with NS2 in 293T or A549 cells. AIMP2
colocalized speciﬁcally with NS2 in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1E) but
not with NS1 (data not shown). Together, these data clearly dem-
onstrate that NS2 is able to physically bind to AIMP2.

To investigate whether the NS2 proteins of other IAV strains
also interact with AIMP2, we performed coimmunoprecipitation
assays with Myc-tagged AIMP2 and HA-tagged NS2 from a low-
pathogenic strain, A/PR/8/34 (H1N1), the NS2 protein of which
exhibited 95% identity with WSN NS2, and a highly pathogenic
strain, A/QH/12/05 (H5N1), the NS2 protein of which had 93%
homology with WSN NS2. As shown in Fig. 1F, AIMP2 interacted
with the NS2 proteins from the two different IAV strains as well.
Identiﬁcation of the NS2-AIMP2-binding region. NS2 can be
divided into an N-terminal protease-sensitive domain and a C-
terminal protease-resistant domain (Fig. 2A). The N-terminal do-
main contains a highly conserved nuclear export signal which is
thought to be required for binding with Crm1. The C-terminal
domain consists of two (cid:3)-helices, C1 and C2, and is essential for
M1 binding (37). Thus, NS2 is believed to be an adaptor protein
during Crm1-mediated nuclear export of vRNPs by forming the
vRNP-M1-NS2-Crm1 complex (12). Here, we found that the N-
terminal domain but not the C-terminal (M1-binding) domain of
NS2 was responsible for the binding with AIMP2 by the GST-
pulldown assay (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, we also identiﬁed the re-
gion of AIMP2 involved in its binding with NS2 by the GST-
pulldown assay. The peptide spanning amino acids (aa) 1 to 160 of
AIMP2 interacted with NS2, while the peptides spanning aa 160
to 320, 1 to 83, and 1 to 320 with deletion of aa 83 to 160
[AIMP2((cid:9)83–160)] did not interact with NS2, implying that
AIMP2 amino acid residues 83 to 160 are essential for binding
with NS2 (Fig. 2C and D).

NS2 inhibits AIMP2 ubiquitination. Under physiological
conditions, AIMP2 is an integral component of the ARS complex.
In response to signals, AIMP2 dissociates from the ARS complex
to participate in a variety of cellular processes (28, 38). The re-
leased AIMP2 can be recognized by E3 ligases, such as Parkin,
leading to its ubiquitination and degradation quickly through the
proteasome pathway (39). Here, we observed that IAV infection
signiﬁcantly decreased the protein levels of AIMP2, while treat-
ment with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 attenuated the re-
duction (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, there was no signiﬁcant differ-
ence in AIMP2 mRNA levels between the cells with or without

endogenous AIMP2 and NS2 in A/WSN/33 virus-infected A549 cells. A549 cells were infected with A/WSN/33 virus at an MOI of 2 for 16 h, and the cell lysates
were immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. (E) Colocalization of HA-NS2 and Flag-AIMP2 in 293T and A549 cells. 293T and
A549 cells were cotransfected with HA-NS2 and Flag-AIMP2. At 28 h posttransfection, the cells were ﬁxed, permeabilized, and stained for Flag-AIMP2 (green)
and HA-NS2 (red). The area stained blue with DAPI represents the nucleus. (F) Coimmunoprecipitation of AIMP2-Myc and HA-NS2 from different IAV strains
in 293T cells. 293T cells were cotransfected with AIMP2-Myc and HA-NS2 from the indicated IAV strains. At 28 h posttransfection, the cell lysates were prepared,
immunoprecipitated, and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. The data in panels A to F are representative of those from at least three independent
experiments.

WSN infection (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that IAV infection
may trigger ubiquitin-mediated degradation of AIMP2. To fur-
ther conﬁrm the ubiquitination of AIMP2 in IAV-infected cells,
293T cells were cotransfected with AIMP2-Myc and HA-Ub, fol-
lowed by infection with A/WSN/33 virus. Immunoprecipitation
experiments clearly indicated that IAV infection enhanced the
ubiquitination of AIMP2 (Fig. 3C). It is known that K48-linked
polyubiquitin chains target proteins for proteasome-mediated

degradation, whereas K63-linked polyubiquitin chains usually
regulate a variety of nonproteolytic cellular functions. Here, we
found that WSN virus infection induced the K48- but not K63-
linked ubiquitination of AIMP2 (Fig. 3D). Given the clear evi-
dence of the interaction between NS2 and AIMP2, we next inves-
tigated whether NS2 was involved in the regulation of AIMP2
ubiquitination. Since no recombinant WSN virus lacking the NS2
gene is available, we studied the effects of NS2 on AIMP2 ubiquiti-

nation in cells transfected with NS2. We observed that the pres-
ence of NS2 eliminated the ubiquitin chain from AIMP2 (Fig. 3E),
supporting the negative regulatory roles of NS2 on AIMP2 ubiq-
uitination. Taken together, our results indicate that IAV infection
induces ubiquitin-dependent AIMP2 degradation and that bind-
ing with NS2 protects AIMP2 from ubiquitin modiﬁcation.

AIMP2 enhances IAV replication by promoting vRNP nu-
clear export. We next investigated whether AIMP2 affected IAV
replication. To this end, 293T cells were transfected with plasmid
pcDNA-AIMP2 with wild-type AIMP2, deletion mutant plasmid
pcDNA-AIMP2((cid:9)83–160) lacking the NS2-binding site, or spe-
ciﬁc siRNA targeting AIMP2 (siAIMP2), followed by infection of
A/WSN/33 or A/PR/8/34 virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI)
of 0.5. The supernatants of infected cells were harvested to deter-
mine virus titers by hemagglutinin assay. As shown in Fig. 4A, for
both the A/WSN/33 and A/PR/8/34 strains, viral titers were in-
creased in AIMP2-overexpressing cells and decreased in AIMP2-
knockdown cells (P (cid:8) 0.01), whereas no signiﬁcant difference was
observed in cells transfected with pcDNA-AIMP2((cid:9)83–160).
Therefore, it is likely that AIMP2 functions as a positive regulator
of IAV replication by binding to NS2. We then investigated how
AIMP2 could inﬂuence IAV replication. 293T cells were trans-
fected with control siRNA (siCtr) or siRNA targeting AIMP2 for
48 h, followed by infection with A/WSN/33 virus at an MOI of 0.5.
At 8, 12, and 16 h postinfection (p.i.), both the culture superna-
tants and whole-cell lysates were assayed by Western blotting with

anti-NP antibody. We observed that AIMP2 knockdown had no
signiﬁcant effect on NP levels in cellular lysates at 8 and 12 h p.i.
but decreased the NP levels in the culture supernatants (virus
particle) at 12 and 16 h p.i. (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that
AIMP2 may not be involved in the early step of viral replication
but most likely has an effect in the late stage, when viral protein
synthesis has started to occur (24, 40). We also performed real-
time PCR to examine whether AIMP2 had any effect on the tran-
scription and replication of the viral genome in the early step of
viral replication. 293T cells were transfected with siCtr, siAIMP2,
or siAIMP2 and pcDNA-AIMP2, followed by infection with
A/WSN/33 virus. The levels of mRNA, cRNA, and vRNA speciﬁc
for the NP segment were measured by real-time PCR with speciﬁc
primers. No signiﬁcant differences in NP mRNA, cRNA, or vRNA
levels were observed among the three groups at 4 and 6 h p.i. (Fig.
4C). Meanwhile, we applied a minireplicon reporter assay to con-
ﬁrm the negligible effect of AIMP2 on RNA-dependent RNA poly-
merase (RdRp) activity. As expected, overexpression of NS2,
which has been shown to inhibit reporter gene expression in this
system, did signiﬁcantly inhibit RdRp activity (P (cid:8) 0.01). In con-
trast, overexpression of AIMP2 did not alter RdRp activity or NS2-
mediated RdRp inhibition (Fig. 4D). Thus, AIMP2 appeared not
to regulate transcription or replication of the genome. Previously,
NS2 has been shown to act as a key adaptor in vRNP nuclear
export (12, 41). The interaction between NS2 and AIMP2
prompted us to investigate whether AIMP2 regulates vRNP nu-

NS2-AIMP2 Interaction Promotes IAV Replication

FIG 3 NS2 inhibits AIMP2 ubiquitination. (A) IAV accelerates the degradation of AIMP2 through the proteome pathway. 293T cells were infected with the
A/WSN/33 virus at an MOI of 1 or left uninfected. At 12 h postinfection, the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 or a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-treated control was
added to the cells for 4 h. Cell lysates were prepared and immunoblotted for AIMP2, NP, and (cid:2)-actin. Relative AIMP2 band intensities were measured using
ImageJ software (NIH). Data are shown as the mean (cid:7) SD from three independent experiments. Statistical signiﬁcance was determined by ANOVA. (B) IAV does
not alter mRNA levels of AIMP2. 293T cells were infected with the A/WSN/33 virus at an MOI of 1 or left uninfected. At 12 h postinfection, AIMP2 mRNA
expression was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR with GAPDH as an internal control. Data represent the mean (cid:7) SD from three independent
experiments. Statistical signiﬁcance was determined by Student’s t test. (C) IAV promotes AIMP2 ubiquitination. 293T cells were cotransfected with AIMP2-Myc
and HA-Ub or an HA control vector for 28 h and then infected with the A/WSN/33 virus at an MOI of 1 or left uninfected for an additional 12 h. The cell lysates
were extracted and immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody. Immunoblotting was performed with HA, Myc, or NP antibodies. (D) IAV induces K48-linked
ubiquitination of AIMP2. 293T cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids for 28 h and then infected with the A/WSN/33 virus at an MOI of 1 for 12 h.
Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. (E) NS2 suppresses AIMP2 ubiquitination. Lysates of 293T cells

clear export. To better track the subcellular localization of vRNPs,
we performed an immunoﬂuorescence assay with anti-NP anti-
body because NP is associated with viral genomic RNA. NP (Fig.
4E, green) was localized in the nucleus at 4 h p.i. and exported to
the cytoplasm at 8 h p.i. in AIMP2-overexpressing cells (Fig. 4E,
red), while NP was still retained in the nucleus at 8 h p.i. in
AIMP2-nonoverexpressing cells (Fig. 4E), indicating that AIMP2
facilitates vRNP nuclear export. The enhancement of the nuclear
export of vRNPs by AIMP2 was further conﬁrmed by analysis of
relative NP levels in the cytoplasm and nucleus when AIMP2 ex-
pression was up- or downregulated. As shown in Fig. 4F (right),

AIMP2 knockdown leads to a decrease in NP levels in the cyto-
plasmic fractions (column 2; P (cid:8) 0.01) and an increase in the
nuclear fractions (column 6; P (cid:8) 0.01). Conversely, AIMP2 over-
expression increases the amounts of NP in the cytoplasmic frac-
tions (column 3; P (cid:8) 0.05) and decreases the nuclear retention of
NP (column 7; P (cid:8) 0.05). While the ectopic expression of AIMP2
was silenced by siAIMP2, there were no alterations in NP levels in
the cytoplasmic fractions or the nuclear fractions (columns 4 and
8, respectively). Collectively, AIMP2 functions as a positive regu-
lator for IAV replication, acting in the steps of vRNP nuclear ex-
port.

AIMP2 enhances the stability of M1. Subsequently, we inves-
tigated how AIMP2 regulates vRNP nuclear export. Since AIMP2
directly binds NS2 and NS2 is an essential adaptor for vRNP nu-
clear export, we hypothesized that AIMP2 may facilitate vRNP
nuclear export by regulating the cellular distribution or expres-
sion of NS2. To test this hypothesis, we transfected 293T cells with
Flag-AIMP2 and HA-NS2 and analyzed the levels of NS2 in cyto-
plasmic and nuclear extracts. The results of Western blot analysis
showed that AIMP2 had no signiﬁcant effect on either the expres-
sion or the distribution of NS2 in the transfected cells (Fig. 5A).
Thus, it is likely that AIMP2 regulates vRNP nuclear export by
targeting other proteins rather than by directly regulating NS2. To
conﬁrm this, we then determined the effects of AIMP2 knock-
down on viral NP and M1, two other important proteins involved
in mediating the nuclear export of vRNPs in IAV-infected cells.
293T cells were transfected with control siRNA or siRNA targeting
AIMP2 for 48 h, followed by infection with A/WSN/33 virus, and
the cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were subjected to Western

blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 5B and C, knockdown of AIMP2
had no signiﬁcant effect on either NS2 or NP protein levels or
cellular localization at the early stage of infection (8 h p.i.). Inter-
estingly, both the protein levels and the nuclear localization of M1
were reduced in AIMP2-knockdown cells at 8 h p.i. (P (cid:8) 0.05),
suggesting that the disruption of AIMP2 negatively regulated M1.
These results were further conﬁrmed by tracing the distribution of
M1 in IAV-infected A549 and 293T cells with or without AIMP2
overexpression. The intensity of immunoﬂuorescence for M1 in
AIMP2-overexpressing cells was higher than that in AIMP2-non-
overexpressing cells, although M1 was mainly localized in the nu-
cleus in both AIMP2-overexpressing and AIMP2-nonoverex-
pressing cells at 6 h p.i. (Fig. 5D). The positive regulation of M1 by
AIMP2 was further conﬁrmed by the increased amount of M1 in
AIMP2-overexpressing cells (P (cid:8) 0.05) and the decreased amount
of M1 in AIMP2-knockdown cells (P (cid:8) 0.01) (Fig. 5E). Together,
these results suggest that AIMP2 increases M1 protein levels upon
IAV infection.

AIMP2 promotes the switch from ubiquitination to
SUMOylation of M1 on K242. AIMP2 increases M1 protein lev-
els (Fig. 5B and E) but not mRNA levels (data not shown), sug-
gesting a possible role of AIMP2 in the regulation of M1 stability.
The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is the most common method
used by cells to degrade endogenous proteins. Therefore, we tested
if it plays a role in the AIMP2-mediated regulation of M1 stability
upon IAV infection. After treatment with the proteasome inhibi-
tor MG-132, the degradation of M1 in AIMP2-knockdown cells
was attenuated (P (cid:8) 0.05) (Fig. 6A), suggesting that AIMP2 pro-
tects M1 from ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Furthermore, we
observed that overexpression of AIMP2 reduced M1 ubiquitina-
tion (Fig. 6B). We next determined the potential ubiquitinated
sites in M1. On the basis of the ubiquitination sites predicted by
two online software tools (BDM-PUB and ubPred), K102, K187,
K230, and K242 were selected for further study. To verify these
predicted sites, we constructed M1 mutants including K102R,
K187R, K230R, and K242R. When K242 was mutated to Arg (R),
the mutant M1 protein in the cells could no longer be modiﬁed by
ubiquitin (Fig. 6C), indicating that K242 is the major, if not the
only, ubiquitin modiﬁcation site of M1. Interestingly, K242 has

been shown to be the SUMO modiﬁcation site on M1 (21). This
ﬁnding was also conﬁrmed in our experiments (Fig. 6D). As both
modiﬁers target the same site on M1, a positive action of AIMP2
on the SUMOylation of M1 was proposed. Accordingly, overex-
pression of AIMP2 increased the efﬁciency of SUMOylation of M1
(Fig. 6E). Collectively, these data strongly suggest that AIMP2
decreases the ubiquitination of K242 on M1 and enhances the
SUMOylation of the same site.

K242 of M1 is essential for IAV replication. To assess the roles
of K242 on M1 in IAV replication, we attempted to generate M1
mutant (K242R) virus by reverse genetics. The M1 mutant
(K242R) virus could be rescued but replicated to signiﬁcantly
lower titers than WT virus (100-fold less) (Fig. 7A) and produced
smaller plaques than WT virus (data not shown). To further char-
acterize the impact of M1 K242 on the viral life cycle, we then
detected the expression of M1 in 293T cells transfected with the 12
plasmids of the virus rescue system containing WT or mutant
(K242R) M1. There was no signiﬁcant difference in the protein
levels between WT M1 and mutant (K242R) M1 at 48 h posttrans-
fection (p.t.). At 72 h posttransfection, the levels of WT M1 were
higher than those of mutant (K242R) M1, which can be explained

by the more efﬁcient WT virus replication at that time point (Fig.
7B). We also traced the intracellular distribution of M1 in 293T
cells transfected with the 12 plasmids of the virus rescue system
containing WT or mutant (K242R) M1. Wild-type M1 could be
detected in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus at 24 h posttrans-
fection (p.t.) and concentrated on the cell membrane at 36 h p.t.
Surprisingly, the K242R mutant was still retained in the nucleus at
36 h p.t. (Fig. 7C), suggesting that the K242R mutation resulted in
the nuclear retention of M1, which may lead to inefﬁcient vRNP
trafﬁcking and virion assembly. To further clarify the effect of
AIMP2 on WT or mutant virus rescue, 293T cells were cotrans-
fected with pcDNA-AIMP2 along with the 12 plasmids containing
WT or mutant M1. The plaque assays indicated that AIMP2 over-
expression promoted WT but not mutant virus propagation (Fig.
7D). The increased efﬁciency of infectious virus particle produc-
tion from AIMP2-overexpressing cells may beneﬁt from the en-
hanced M1 protein levels (Fig. 7E). On the contrary, AIMP2 had

no effect on the protein levels of K242R mutant M1. These data
suggest that K242 of M1 is essential for IAV replication and
AIMP2-mediated enhancement of IAV replication is dependent
on K242 of M1.

DISCUSSION
Although ubiquitination of M1 during IAV infection has been
observed (42), the precise modiﬁcation site and the molecular
consequences of this modiﬁcation remain obscure. Here, we
showed that ubiquitin and SUMO competed for the same lysine
(K242) site on M1 to control the cellular localization of M1 and
regulate its function in vRNP nuclear export and virus assembly
during IAV infection. Interaction of NS2 with AIMP2 facilitated
the switch from the ubiquitination to the SUMOylation of M1,
thereby increasing virus replication.

Our model for the regulatory roles of the AIMP2-NS2 interac-
tion in M1 posttranslational modiﬁcations is presented in Fig. 8.

AIMP2 is incorporated into the ARS complex under physiological
conditions and dissociates from the complex upon IAV infection.
The released AIMP2 can be recognized and ubiquitinated by E3
ubiquitin ligases, such as Parkin, and then degraded. To prevent
ubiquitin-mediated degradation of AIMP2, NS2 quickly interacts
with AIMP2 to keep it away from E3 ligase. Following binding
with NS2, AIMP2 recruitment prevents the K242-mediated ubiq-
uitination and degradation of M1 by an unknown mechanism.
M1 then translocates into the nucleus, where it is SUMOylated at
K242. The SUMOylation of M1 may induce a conformational
change or an alteration of the protein-protein interaction, an ef-
fect likely attributable to vRNP nuclear export and the following
viral assembly and budding.

Ubiquitination of M1 was ﬁrst reported by Liu and colleagues
(42), who showed that overexpression of CypA increases the ubiq-
uitination and degradation of M1 to restrict IAV replication. A
recent report by Su et al. has demonstrated that Itch, an E3 ligase,
interacts with M1 and mediates the ubiquitination of M1 during
the virus entry process (24). They speculate that Itch-mediated
ubiquitination of M1 facilitates the dissociation of viral RNA from
M1 and the subsequent transport of vRNP to the nucleus (24). In
this regard, ubiquitination of M1 during the virus entry process is

beneﬁcial to the viral life cycle. However, for the newly synthesized
M1, Itch- or other E3 ligase-mediated ubiquitination and degra-
dation of M1 are undoubtedly limiting factors for the production
of progeny virus. Therefore, inﬂuenza virus develops strategies to
evade recognition by host E3 ligase. Here we present evidence that
the interaction between NS2 and AIMP2 prevents M1 from ubiq-
uitin-mediated degradation. Moreover, we identify K242 to be the
major, if not the only, ubiquitin modiﬁcation site of M1. Interest-
ingly, K242 has been shown to be the SUMO modiﬁcation site on
M1 (21). Different
from ubiquitin-mediated degradation,
SUMOylation usually alters protein-protein interactions, induces
a conformational change, or promotes a relocalization of the tar-
get protein within the cell (43). K242-mediated M1 SUMOylation
has been suggested to control the maturation and assembly of
inﬂuenza virus particles by facilitating the interaction between M1
and vRNPs (21). As both modiﬁers target the same lysine on M1,
the negative effect of ubiquitin on M1 may result not only from
the degradation of M1 but also from the occupation of the SUMO
attachment site lysine residue on M1. Therefore, AIMP2-medi-
ated inhibition of M1 ubiquitination leads to increased M1 stabil-
ity and the release of K242 for SUMO modiﬁcation.

FIG 8 Proposed model for AIMP2 as a positive regulator of inﬂuenza virus replication. AIMP2 is incorporated into the ARS complex under physiological
conditions. Following IAV infection, AIMP2 dissociates from the ARS complex and the released AIMP2 can be ubiquitinated by Parkin or another E3 ligase for
degradation. To prevent ubiquitin-mediated degradation of AIMP2, NS2 is able to interact with AIMP2 to keep it away from ubiquitination. Following binding
with NS2, AIMP2 recruitment prevents K242-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of M1. M1 then translocates into the nucleus, where it is SUMOylated
at K242. The SUMOylation of M1 facilitates the formation of the NS2-M1-vRNP complex, modulates the nuclear export of vRNPs, and promotes the assembly
and budding of progeny virions.

machinery, the ARS complex. In response to signals, such as DNA
damage (27, 38) or TNF-(cid:3) stimulation (29), AIMP2 dissociates
from the complex to participate in a variety of cellular processes.
AIMP2 has been shown to stabilize p53 via an apparently inde-
pendent mechanism in response to oxidative stress. On the one
hand, AIMP2 directly interacts with p53, preventing MDM2-me-
diated ubiquitination and the degradation of p53 (27); on the
other hand, AIMP2 coactivates FBP to induce ubiquitin-speciﬁc
peptidase 29 (USP29) expression. USP29 binds to p53, cleaves
polyubiquitin chains from p53, and stabilizes p53 (38). Upon IAV
infection, AIMP2 dissociates from the ARS complex in order to
participate in the cellular antiviral response. We present data that
the released AIMP2 could be readily hijacked by NS2 to prevent
M1 from ubiquitin-mediated degradation. How AIMP2 inhibits
M1 ubiquitination remains unclear. It is possible that AIMP2 dis-
turbs the interaction between M1 and its E3 ligase or regulates the
activity of E3 ligase or a deubiquitinating enzyme that acts on M1.
These questions need to be further investigated.

Collectively, the ﬁndings from this study provide proof of prin-
ciple that AIMP2 promotes IAV replication by interaction with
NS2 to facilitate the switch from K242-mediated ubiquitination to
SUMOylation of M1. The present work may point toward a newly
identiﬁed regulatory mechanism used by IAV to ensure its life
cycle.
