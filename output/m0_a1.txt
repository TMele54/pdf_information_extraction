Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-interacting multifunctional protein 2 (AIMP2) is a non-
enzymatic component required for the multi-tRNA synthetase complex. While exon 2 skip-
ping alternatively spliced variant of AIMP2 (AIMP2-DX2) compromises AIMP2 activity and is
associated with carcinogenesis, its clinical potential awaits further validation. Here, we found
that AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 expression ratio is strongly correlated with major cancer signaling
pathways and poor prognosis, particularly in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Analysis of a
clinical patient cohort revealed that AIMP2-DX2 positive AML patients show decreased
overall survival and progression-free survival. We also developed targeted RNA-sequencing
and single-molecule RNA-FISH tools to quantitatively analyze AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 ratios at
the single-cell level. By subclassifying hematologic cancer cells based on their AIMP2-DX2/
AIMP2 ratios, we found that downregulating AIMP2-DX2 sensitizes cells to anticancer drugs
only for a subgroup of cells while it has adverse effects on others. Collectively, our study
establishes AIMP2-DX2 as a potential biomarker and a therapeutic target for hematologic
cancer.

COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-020-01353-x

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-interacting multifunctional

protein 2 (AIMP2) is a component of a macromolecular
protein complex consisting of several different aminoacyl-
tRNA synthetases (MSC). It is a nonenzymatic auxiliary com-
ponent required for the integration and stability of this transla-
tional complex1,2. In addition, AIMP2 can also act as a potent
tumor suppressor3. In response to DNA damage, a fraction of
AIMP2 dissociates from the MSC, and induces apoptosis by
binding to p53 and protecting p53 from degradation through
ubiquitination by murine double minute 2 (MDM2)4. In addition,
AIMP2 augments tumor necrosis factor-α-induced apoptotic
signaling and exerts antiproliferative activities in TGF-β and Wnt
pathways via distinct working mechanisms3,5,6. Given that these
pathways are critically implicated in the control of tumorigenesis,
AIMP2 is expected to act as a potent tumor suppressor with
broad coverage against various types of cancer. In fact, AIMP2
haploid mice showed increased tumor susceptibility compared to
the wild-type littermates to carcinogenic treatment, conﬁrming its
tumor-suppressive activity in vivo3.

The full-length AIMP2 transcript consists of four exons, but a
small fraction of the pre-mRNA undergoes alternative splicing to
lacking the second exon (AIMP2-DX2).
produce a variant
AIMP2-DX2 protein compromises the tumor-suppressive activity
of AIMP2 via competitive binding to p53, but fails to protect p53
from MDM2-mediated ubiquitination7. In contrast to AIMP2,
which is mainly bound to the MSC, AIMP2-DX2 cannot work as
a scaffold for MSC assembly, and thus works as a potent com-
petitor for the tumor-suppressive activities of AIMP27.

AIMP2-DX2 is receiving increasing attention as an attractive
biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis7,8. Moreover, AIMP2-
DX2 showed potential as a therapeutic target, since the down-
regulation of AIMP2-DX2 suppressed the growth of cancer cells
and tumors in vivo7,8. Therefore, quantifying AIMP2-DX2
expression would allow subclassiﬁcation of cancer patients and
identify those who may undergo AIMP2-DX2 targeting treat-
ment. Despite the mounting pieces of evidence, the expression of
AIMP2-DX2 and its clinical
implications in various types of
cancer have not yet been clearly demonstrated.

The clinical application of AIMP2-DX2 has been limited due
to the lack of a detection technique that allows a quantitative
assessment of the AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 expression ratio. Cur-
rently,
the primary experimental approach relies on PCR
ampliﬁcation and examining the size difference between the
two splicing variants through electrophoresis, which cannot be
applied to analyze patient samples. Molecular beacon-based
detection technique has been developed9, but
its clinical
applicability is questionable. Moreover, molecular beacon fails
to examine both AIMP2 and AIMP2-DX2 mRNAs simulta-
neously in the same group of cells. Considering the competitive
situation of AIMP2-DX2 and AIMP2 in carcinogenesis,
simultaneous quantitation of the two variants is expected to
provide a more relevant marker for accurate assessment of
patient samples.

In situ hybridization (ISH) uses nucleic acid probes that are
complementary to the target DNA/RNA sequences to detect and
visualize the target. Clinically, DNA-ISH has been widely used to
visualize DNA pathogenic variants or chromosomal structures10.
However, as DNA does not provide information on gene
expression, in particular those of alternatively spliced RNA var-
iants, RNA-ISH is an alternative approach to investigate mRNA
expressions. In addition, RNA-ISH allows analysis at a single-cell
level with minimal sample disruption, which makes it an attrac-
tive clinical
tool. Moreover, using multiplex single-molecule
ﬂuorescence ISH (smFISH), expression levels of both AIMP2 and
its splicing variant AIMP2-DX2 mRNAs can be quantiﬁed and
compared together in the same cells.

In the present study, we investigated the signiﬁcance and
clinical implications of AIMP2-DX2 by analyzing samples from
the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, and validated results
with a clinical patient cohort of acute myeloid leukemia (AML),
which was found to have the most signiﬁcant association with
AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 expression ratio in terms of cancer signaling
pathways. The potential of AIMP2-DX2 as a key regulator of
major cancer signaling pathways in AML was further analyzed
using AML cell line, which further supported our analysis of
public databases. Moreover, to satisfy the unmet clinical need for
a quantitative assessment of the AIMP2-DX2 expression ratio at
the single-cell level, we developed an RNA-smFISH-based image
analysis tool to measure AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 expression ratio.
Our image analysis showed good concordance with targeted
RNA-sequencing, an alternative method to quantitate the
AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 expression ratio. Applying our image-based
quantiﬁcation tool, we subclassiﬁed seven hematologic cancers
based on their AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 expression ratios. More
importantly, we showed that targeting AIMP2-DX2 expression in
those cells with a high AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 expression ratio
could sensitize cells to anticancer drugs. To our surprise, we also
found that targeting AIMP2-DX2 in cells with a low AIMP2-
DX2/AIMP2 expression ratio had adverse effects and made cells
more resistant to anticancer drugs. Collectively, our work pro-
vides the development of tools for quantitative assessment of
alternatively spliced variants and clinical implications of AIMP2-
DX2, as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in hema-
tologic cancer.

Results
Quantitation of the AIMP2-DX2 expression ratio by RNA-
smFISH. To examine the pathophysiological
implications of
AIMP2 and AIMP2-DX2 in carcinogenesis, we assessed their
basal mRNA expression levels using the multiplex RNAscope
smFISH technique11. We ﬁrst designed smFISH ZZ probe pairs
that targeted only the exon 2 and tagged them as channel 1 (C1).
We designed another set of ZZ probe pairs that recognized exons
1, 3, and 4, and tagged them as channel 2 (C2). By simultaneously
hybridizing and amplifying these two sets of probes, we could
visualize AIMP2 mRNAs in one color (green; C1), while another
color can be designated to visualize both AIMP2 and AIMP2-
DX2 mRNAs (red; C2; Fig. 1a). We tested our design using HeLa
cells, and found that both C1 and C2 probes yielded foci-like
signal patterns (Fig. 1b). As a control, we performed RNA-
smFISH without hybridization of C1 and C2 probes, which
resulted in no ﬂuorescent signal (Fig. 1b). By quantifying and
determining the red-to-green signal ratios, we can infer the
relative expression ratio of AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 mRNA variants
(Fig. 1b).

To test the speciﬁcity of the probes, we ﬁrst transfected HeLa
cells with siRNAs that target AIMP2 or AIMP2-DX2 mRNAs,
and examined the expression change using our
smFISH
quantiﬁcation approach. Through western blotting, we conﬁrmed
the knockdown of AIMP2 and AIMP2-DX2 protein expressions
(Fig. 1c). In the smFISH quantitation approach, we found that the
knockdown of AIMP2 signiﬁcantly increased the red-to-green
ratio from 2.95 to 4.05 (P value = 0.022; Fig. 1d, e). Using RT-
qPCR, we conﬁrmed that the knockdown efﬁciency of AIMP2
was over 90%, which was also reﬂected in decreased AIMP2
protein expression (Fig. 1c, f). When we analyzed siAIMP2-DX2-
transfected samples,
ratio was decreased only
signal
moderately (Fig. 1d, e). This was unexpected as C1 probes
recognize only the full-length AIMP2, which should not be
affected by siAIMP2-DX2 transfection. Our data imply that

AIMP2 expression can be positively associated with that of
AIMP-DX2, considering their competitive relationship in func-
tion. Namely, increased expression of AIMP2-DX2 can provoke
the expression of AIMP2, and the reverse can also be true. In this
context, siAIMP2-DX2 siRNA may downregulate both AIMP2
and AIMP2-DX2 mRNAs, which may result in a moderate

change in the expression ratio of the two variants. Upon closer
examination, we found a signiﬁcant decrease in the ﬂuorescent
signal from the green channel, which reﬂected a reduction of
AIMP2 expression (Fig. 1d). We further conﬁrmed our imaging
data using RT-qPCR, which showed that siAIMP2-DX2 transfec-
tion indeed decreased AIMP2 mRNAs by ~40% (Fig. 1f). This

decrease in mRNA expression was also translated to a moderate
reduction of AIMP2 protein expression in siAIMP2-DX2-
transfected cells (Fig. 1c). Of note, quantifying the conventional
PCR-based detection approach also showed a change in the
expression ratio of the two variants (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b).
To examine whether our RNA-smFISH approach can be
applied in cells other than HeLa, particularly for lung carcinomas
where AIMP2-DX2 was reported for the ﬁrst time7, we quantiﬁed
the AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 expression ratio in A549 lung adeno-
carcinoma cells (Fig. 1g, h). We again conﬁrmed the speciﬁcity of
our quantiﬁcation using siRNAs (Fig. 1h). We then compared the
AIMP2-DX2 expression ratios between HeLa and A549 cells.
A549 cells showed a red-to-green ratio that was signiﬁcantly
higher than that of HeLa cells (Fig. 1i), which is consistent with
the previous reports that the AIMP2-DX2 variant is frequently
observed in lung carcinomas7. Of note, due to differences in
the number of ZZ pairs between the two channels, we found that
the efﬁciencies of the probes in capturing their target mRNAs
were different. This resulted in only a few overlapping foci
because there are always more red foci
than the green.
Consequently, we could not quantitate the absolute expression
ratio of AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 mRNAs. Nevertheless, the quanti-
ﬁed ﬂuorescence ratios consistently reﬂected changes in AIMP2
and AIMP2-DX2 mRNAs in siRNA-transfected samples. There-
fore, our approach semiquantitatively reﬂects changes in the
ratios of
the two variants upon siRNA transfection and in
different cellular contexts.

Correlation of AIMP2-DX2 ratio with major cancer pathways.
To test the carcinogenic potential of AIMP2-DX2 in various types
of cancer, we analyzed the transcriptome data from 753 cancer
patients over 23 cancer types in the ICGC/TCGA database for
high-throughput analysis of AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 expression
ratios. The median age of patients from whom these samples were
derived was 59 years (range 17–90 years), and 46.1% were male
(Supplementary Table 1). When we visualized mapped sequen-
cing reads on the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV), we could
clearly observe sequencing reads corresponding to the AIMP2-
DX2 mRNA, where they completely skipped the second exon
(Fig. 2a). Using the ICGC and TCGA data, we directly quantiﬁed
the sequencing reads spanning across exons 1–2 (AIMP2) and
exons 1–3 (AIMP2-DX2), and determined the expression ratio
between the two variants. We found that all types of examined
cancer patients exhibited variable levels of AIMP2-DX2, where
the ratio of AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 fell into the range from 0 to 60%
(Fig. 2b).

(ovarian cancer, breast

In a differentially expressed gene (DEG) set analysis, 10 out of
13 predeﬁned major cancer pathways were shown to correlate
with the AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 expression ratio to different
degrees and directions among 14 cancer types (Fig. 2c), while
the other 9 cancer
invasive
carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, melanoma, rectum adenocar-
cinoma, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, prostate adenocarci-
noma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and uterine
corpus endometrial carcinoma) did not show clear correlations.
Interestingly, most of the major cancer pathways in AML were
highly upregulated in patients with high AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2
expression ratios (Fig. 2c). Whole differentially expressed path-
ways by the AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 expression ratio are available in
Supplementary Fig. 2.

We further analyzed the clinical implication of AIMP2-DX2 in
hematologic cancer by analyzing AML samples from the ICGC/

of patients was 60 years (range 21–82 years), and the female to
male ratio was 10:9. Using a cutoff ratio of 0.04, which was the
ﬁrst quartile value (Q1) of the AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 expression
ratio in AML, a Kaplan–Meier curve for the overall survival (OS)
showed that patients with an AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 expression
ratio ≥Q1
tended to exhibit poor OS (median survival
47.7 months) compared to those with an AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2
expression ratio <Q1 (median survival not reached; log-rank P =
0.25; Fig. 3a). Of note, AIMP2-DX2 exists as a free form and is
not associated with MSC7. Considering that most AIMP2 protein
exists in MSC12, and only a fraction becomes dissociated to
mediate stress response4, a small amount of AIMP2-DX2 com-
pared to total AIMP2 (free + MSC associated) can still act as a
potent inhibitor of AIMP2. Two-sample t statistics estimated by
the generally applicable gene-set enrichment (GAGE) method for
16 AML patients with AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 ratios ≥0.04 and 6
AML patients with AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 ratios <0.04 are sum-
marized in Fig. 3b, with corresponding false discovery rate (FDR)
q values. The most differentially expressed pathway by AIMP2-
DX2/AIMP2 expression ratio was the mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway (q = 3.64 × 10−8; Fig. 3b).

To corroborate the prognostic value of AIMP2-DX2 in AML,
we investigated the correlation between AIMP2-DX2 expression
and survival outcomes in a clinical validation cohort of AML.
For a total of 51 AML patients included in this analysis, the
median age was 54.3 years (range 20.4–83.8 years; Table 1), and
23 out of 51 patients (45.1%) were female. The most common
French–American–British (FAB) classiﬁcation subtype was M2
(33.3%); most of the patients (64.7%) were classiﬁed into an
intermediate-risk group by the Medical Research Council (MRC)
criteria. Of a total of 51 AML patients, 29 patients (56.9%)

were negative for AIMP2-DX2 by RT-PCR at

AIMP2-DX2. Although no statistically signiﬁcant clinical char-
acteristics was found between the two groups, AIMP2-DX2-
negative patients tended to be in a high-risk MRC group
compared with AIMP2-DX2-positive patients, while the median
age of AIMP2-DX2-negative patients was younger than that of
AIMP2-DX2-positive patients.

In this cohort of AML patients, there were statistically signiﬁcant
differences in the OS (log-rank P = 0.018) and progression-free
survival (PFS; log-rank P = 0.004) rates according to AIMP2-DX2
positivity determined by RT-PCR (Fig. 3c, d). The OS of the
AIMP2-DX2-positive group (median survival 11.7 (5.03–29.6)
months) was signiﬁcantly inferior to that of the AIMP2-DX2-
negative group (median survival not reached) with a hazard ratio
(HR) of 2.47 (95% CI, 1.14–5.34; P = 0.022). Adjustment by age
and MRC risk group gave an HR for OS of 2.48 (95% CI,
1.12–5.52; P = 0.026). Similarly, the AIMP2-DX2-positive group
showed a worse PFS (median survival 5.97 (3.07–13.8) months)
compared to the AIMP2-DX2-negative group (median survival
19.93 (7.10–not reached) months; HR, 2.59; 95% CI, 1.32–5.11;
P = 0.006). The HR for PFS, adjusted by age, and MRC risk group,
was 2.71 (95% CI, 1.35–5.45; P = 0.005).

The implication of the AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 expression ratio
for OS and tumor-node-metastasis stage was further investigated
in other cancer types (Supplementary Fig. 3). Similar to AML,
samples with an AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 expression ratio ≥Q1
tended to exhibit an inferior OS in colon carcinoma (log-rank
P = 0.28), and hepatocellular carcinoma (log-rank P = 0.24). For
these cancer types, although statistically insigniﬁcant, the AIMP2-

DX2/AIMP2 expression ratio showed a tendency toward
increasing along with the stage. Additional studies with a larger
patient number will be able to delineate clinical implications of
the AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 expression ratio in these cancers. In
contrast, such a prognostic value and correlation with the stage
were not evident

in other cancer types. Analysis of

Subclassiﬁcation of hematologic cancer based on the AIMP2-
DX2 ratio. The analysis of ICGC/TCGA database and the AML
patient cohort result showed strong evidence for the potential
role, and the clinical implication of AIMP2-DX2 in blood cancers.
In fact, hematologic malignancy is cancer with a close relation-
ship with p53 dysregulation, where AIMP2-DX2 may play a key
regulatory function13,14. However, the current strategy to quan-
titate AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 expression ratio relies on RT-PCR,
which is prone to high false-positive rates due to analysis at the
population level. In particular, even normal cells can express a
low level of AIMP2-DX2, indicating that the percentage of cancer
cells in the population may affect the expression ratio of AIMP2-
DX2/AIMP2. We turned to imaged-based RNA-smFISH for
increased accuracy in quantifying the AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2
expression ratio, as this approach allows analysis at the single-
cell level.

To establish smFISH as a subclassiﬁcation tool in hematologic
cancer, we performed RNA-smFISH and quantitated expression
ratios of AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 in six different blood cancer cell

Fig. 4b indicates the red-to-green ratio per image, which is an
average of ~18 cells.

One advantage of our approach is that it allows image-based
analysis at the single-cell level. We ﬁrst identiﬁed individual cells
based on the DAPI nuclei counterstain. We then assigned red and
green signals to a cell based on the distance to the closest DAPI
signal. Once the ﬂuorescent signals were assigned, we determined
the red-to-green signal ratio for individual cells. The single-cell
analysis
resulted in increased variation due to cell-to-cell
variabilities, but the overall subclassiﬁcation remained the same
(Fig. 4c). Of note, we also performed the single-cell analysis on
adherent cells (HeLa and A549) and again obtained the same
conclusion that the expression ratio of AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 is
higher in A549 cells (Supplementary Fig. 4).

To validate the AIMP2-DX2 expression patterns, we per-
formed targeted RNA-sequencing and compared the sequencing

result with that of RNA-smFISH image analyses. We analyzed 16
human cancer cell lines (Supplementary Table 2), and seven (six
blood cancer cell lines and A549) of which were also used in the
RNA-smFISH analysis. The expression ratios of AIMP2-DX2/
AIMP2 were calculated using the same approach as our analysis
of the ICGC/TCGA data. A comparison of RNA-smFISH single-
image quantitation, single-cell analysis, and targeted RNA-
sequencing is summarized in Fig. 4d. We found that relative
ratios of the two variants in these six blood cancer cell lines
showed good agreement with that of the RNA-smFISH analysis
(Fig. 4d). Collectively, these results show that RNA-smFISH
image analysis can be a reliable tool to quantitatively analyze and
subclassify cells based on their expression ratio of AIMP2-DX2/
AIMP2.

Drug sensitization by modulating AIMP2-DX2 expression.
Considering the working mechanism of AIMP2-DX2, that it
inhibits the protective activity of AIMP2 on p53 during stress, we
investigated whether targeting AIMP2-DX2 expression can sen-
sitize cells to anticancer drugs. More importantly, we asked
whether such sensitization depends on the expression ratio of
AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2. For those cells with a low ratio, targeting
AIMP2-DX2 should not have any effect, while cells with a high
ratio should result in increased cell death. To target AIMP2-DX2,
we performed electroporation with siAIMP2-DX2 to three blood

lines. HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells, which
expressed the highest ratio of AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2, clearly
showed decreased expression of AIMP2-DX2 (Fig. 5a). The
expression of AIMP2-DX2 in the other two cell lines was too low
to be detectable. However, we optimized the electroporation
condition using a control target and applied the same condition
to transfect siAIMP2-DX2.

We treated a low dose of paclitaxel to HL-60 and compared the
drug sensitivity after downregulating AIMP2-DX2 (Fig. 5b and
Supplementary Fig. 5a). We chose paclitaxel as an anticancer
interest because apoptosis induced by a low-dose
drug of
treatment of paclitaxel
associated with normal p53
expression15,16. In our experiment, we asked whether sensitivity
to paclitaxel could be enhanced by targeting AIMP2-DX2 in
hematologic cancer. More importantly, we examined whether
such effect depends on the expression ratio of AIMP2-DX2/
AIMP2 quantiﬁed by RNA-smFISH. Consistent with our
expectation, knockdown of AIMP2-DX2 signiﬁcantly decreased
cell viability upon paclitaxel treatment in HL-60 cells (Fig. 5b). As

is

a comparison, we used Namalwa Burkitt’s lymphoma cells, which
expressed a low ratio of AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2. Unexpectedly,
knockdown of AIMP2-DX2 expression resulted in increased cell
viability upon paclitaxel treatment (Fig. 5c). One possibility is the
positive association between AIMP2 and AIMP2-DX2, as we
found earlier (Fig. 1d, f). In this context, downregulating AIMP2-
DX2 resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in the full-length AIMP2
expression, which compromised normal p53 function. Conse-
quently, cells with low AIMP2-DX2 expression showed adverse
effects to paclitaxel treatment.

Lastly, we used KMS-12-BM myeloma cells, which expressed
the intermediate AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 expression ratio. In this
case, knockdown of AIMP2-DX2 did not show a signiﬁcant effect
on drug sensitivity, suggesting that targeting AIMP2-DX2 may
not provide any beneﬁt for the intermediate expression group
(Fig. 5d). Our
targeting AIMP2-DX2
indicate that
expression can be an effective clinical strategy to enhance the
efﬁcacy of paclitaxel. Furthermore, prior quantiﬁcation of
AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 expression ratio appears to be critical as

targeting AIMP2-DX2 mRNA. AIMP2-DX2 protein was detected only in HL-60, but not in Namalwa nor KMS-12-BM cells. In HL-60 cells, siAIMP2-DX2
effectively reduced the AIMP2-DX2 protein expression. TUBB was used as loading control. b–d Knockdown of AIMP2-DX2 enhanced apoptosis induced by
paclitaxel, etoposide, and cisplatin in HL-60 cells (b), but not in Namalwa (c) nor KMS-12-BM cells (d). For Namalwa cells, knockdown of AIMP2-DX2
partially rescued the cell death by all drugs. n = 4 for paclitaxel in all three cell lines. n = 3 for HL-60, n = 7 for Namalwa, n = 4 for KMS-12-BM for
etoposide. n = 6 for HL-60, n = 9 for Namalwa, n = 9 for KMS-12-BM for cisplatin. A solid red line indicates cell viability relative to siLuc, while a black

targeting AIMP2-DX2 expression in cells with a low AIMP2-
DX2/AIMP2 expression ratio can provoke adverse effect, as in the
case of Namalwa cells.

We performed an analogous set of experiments, but this time
using etoposide or cisplatin instead of paclitaxel
to trigger
apoptosis. We chose etoposide because it induces DNA damage
and initiates p53 signaling17,18. In addition, cisplatin is a p53-
dependent anticancer drug19,20, currently being used to treat
refractory lymphomas and AML21–24. We found that only the
high AIMP2-DX2-expressing HL-60 cells could be sensitized to
etoposide and cisplatin via knockdown of AIMP2-DX2 (Fig. 5b).
At the same time, transfecting Namalwa cells with siAIMP2-DX2

again showed the adverse effect, where it partially rescued cell
death by etoposide and cisplatin (Fig. 5c). Lastly,
targeting
AIMP2-DX2 did not have any effect on apoptotic response in
KMS-12-BM cells (Fig. 5d). Together, our results clearly indicate
that targeting AIMP2-DX2 expression can be used to enhance the
effectiveness of anticancer drugs, such as paclitaxel, etoposide,
and cisplatin that rely on the p53 signaling pathway.

Targeting AIMP2-DX2 in AML affects major cancer pathways.
Considering the ICGC/TCGA analysis that several cancer path-
ways showed a positive correlation with the ratio of AIMP2-DX2/
AIMP2 in AML, we extended our analysis using ML-1 AML cells.

First, we applied the RNA-smFISH approach to quantitate the
AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 expression ratio in ML-1 cells. We found
that the red-to-green ratio has a mean value of 8.43, which
categorizes ML-1 to a high expression group (Fig. 6a). This is
consistent with the targeted RNA-sequencing result that ML-1 is
one of the cell lines with a high expression ratio of AIMP2-DX2/
AIMP2 (Supplementary Table 2). Next, we utilized these cells to
verify the result of
the ICGC/TCGA database analysis that
AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 expression ratio correlates with major
cancer signaling pathways in AML. We knocked down the
expression of AIMP2-DX2 by transfecting siAIMP2-DX2 and
examined its effect on components of p53, MAPK, and JAK-
STAT signaling pathways using RT-qPCR. Among the genes

examined, p38α and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) of MAPK
signaling and JAK1-3 and STAT1 of JAK-STAT signaling showed
a positive correlation with the AIMP2-DX2 expression (Fig. 6b).
This is consistent with our analysis of the ICGC/TCGA database
that AIMP2-DX2 is positively correlated with MAPK and JAK-
STAT signaling pathways in AML (Figs. 2c and 3b). On the
contrary, we could not ﬁnd a correlation between p53 signaling
pathway and AIMP2-DX2 expression. Nevertheless, our data
suggest that AIMP2-DX2 may regulate tumorigenesis in AML.

We further investigated whether targeting AIMP2-DX2 can
sensitize cells to anticancer drugs. Considering that ML-1 belongs
to a high expression ratio group, downregulating AIMP2-DX2
should sensitize cells to the drug treatment. Indeed, similar to the

case of HL-60, knockdown of AIMP2-DX2 resulted in increased
sensitivity to paclitaxel, etoposide, and,
to a limited degree,
cisplatin (Fig. 6c and Supplementary Fig. 6). We then examined
the activation of the p53 signaling pathway when cells were
treated with etoposide, using qPCR and western blotting.
Although our earlier analysis showed no correlation between
p53 signaling and AIMP2-DX2 without any stressor (Fig. 6b),
when we treated etoposide, p21 and PUMA mRNAs were
strongly induced in AIMP2-DX2-deﬁcient cells (Fig. 6d). More-
over, we found increased phosphorylation of p53 and increased
expression of PUMA protein when etoposide was treated in
AIMP2-DX2 knockdown cells (Fig. 6e). Collectively, these data
support that the downregulation of AIMP2-DX2 in ML-1 cells
can affect their response to anticancer drugs by modulating
p53 signaling pathway.

Discussion
In this study, we developed an RNA-smFISH image analysis tool
to quantify the expression ratio of
tumorigenic alternatively
spliced AIMP2-DX2. Together with the analysis of the public
database, we found that AIMP2-DX2 was universally expressed to
varying degrees among diverse cancers, and that the AIMP2-
DX2/AIMP2 expression ratio estimated by RNA-smFISH could
be reliable indicators of AIMP2-DX2 expression. Of 23 types of
cancer
ICGC/TCGA database, AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2
expression ratio was most strongly correlated with major cancer
pathways, such as the MAPK signaling pathway, in AML. More
importantly, subclassiﬁcation of hematologic cancers based on
their AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 expression ratios can be used to design
patient-speciﬁc treatment strategies. As a proof of concept, we
showed that targeting AIMP2-DX2 sensitized cells to paclitaxel,
etoposide, and cisplatin treatments only in those cells with a high
AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 expression ratio. Moreover, the expression
ratio of AIMP2-DX2 also had prognostic value in AML.

in the

AML is ranked among the most

lethal of hematological
malignancies. Despite extensive efforts that have been put for-
ward into understanding the pathogenesis of AML, the outcome
for adult patients with AML remains poor in the form of a high
mortality rate25. Therefore, better knowledge of the disease’s
pathology, as well as novel therapeutic strategies, are exigent. In
the present study, AIMP2-DX2 expression in AML positively
correlated with most major cancer pathways, which have crucial
roles in tumorigenesis and are suggested to be potential targets in
AML patients26. In addition, patients with positive AIMP2-DX2
expression exhibited inferior survival outcomes. These results
indicate that AIMP2-DX2 could be a potential biomarker of AML
and a novel therapeutic target.

lung cancer

The efﬁcacy of targeting AIMP2-DX2 for controlling tumor-
igenesis has already been reported in lung and ovarian cancers,
using both in vivo and in vitro models. As a result, several novel
pharmaceuticals having such activity are currently under devel-
opment. For example, a small chemical compound called BC-
DXI01 showed speciﬁc inhibitory activity in AIMP2-DX2-
lines by selectively suppressing
positive
AIMP2-DX2 mRNA27. Similarly, SLCB050, a novel chemical
compound that blocks the interaction between AIMP2-DX2 and
p14ARF, reduced the viability of lung cancer cells28. Moreover, a
trans-splicing ribozyme targeting AIMP2-DX2 mRNA showed
speciﬁc and effective retardation of lung cancer29. In this regard,
suppressing AIMP2-DX2 expression could theoretically be a
novel therapeutic strategy for AML as well. Indeed, we showed
that downregulating AIMP2-DX2 expression in ML-1 AML cells
resulted in increased cell death by paclitaxel, etoposide, and to a
certain degree, cisplatin. At the same time, targeting AIMP2-DX2
can result in adverse effects in a subgroup of cells with a low

cell

AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 expression ratio, most likely due to the
positive association between AIMP2 and AIMP2-DX2. Thus,
discovering novel drugs targeting AIMP2-DX2 and determining
its working mechanism at the molecular level would likely con-
tribute to an improvement in the treatment of AML and other
hematologic cancer patients.

According to our analysis, AIMP2-DX2 expression ratio is
positively correlated with MAPK and JAK-STAT signaling
pathways in AML. This is consistent with previous studies that
showed the importance of these pathways in AML. It has been
shown that JNK contributes to drug resistance and hyperleuko-
cytosis in AML30. In addition, p38 MAPK positively regulates
proliferation in hematopoietic cells31. Moreover, activated JAKs
phosphorylate STAT proteins which results in their dimerization
and translocalization into the nucleus to transcribe genes involved
in cell survival and proliferation32. One study reported elevated
levels of p-JAK2 in bone marrow samples from patients with
AML (n = 77) and its correlation to shorter survival in patients,
with either de novo or secondary AML32,33. Indeed, treating AML
cells with AZ960, a JAK2 inhibitor, induced apoptosis, indicating
the importance of JAK-STAT signaling. In the future, investiga-
tion on the regulation of MAPK and JAK-STAT signaling systems
by AIMP2-DX2 may provide a better understanding of tumor-
igenesis of AML.

Considering the tumorigenic activity of AIMP2-DX2 and its
universal expression, the potential of AIMP2-DX2 as a biomarker
would not be limited to AML. For colon adenocarcinoma and
hepatocellular carcinoma in the ICGC/TCGA database, although
statistical signiﬁcance was not met, patients with an AIMP2-DX2/
AIMP2 expression ratio ≥Q1 displayed worse survival outcomes
(Supplementary Fig. 3). On the other hand, such a tendency was
not observed in lung cancer patients. However, considering the
retrospective nature of clinical information in the ICGC/TCGA
database,
this result should be interpreted with caution. In
addition, the application of Q1 as a cutoff value in lung cancer
may bias this result because the optimal cutoff AIMP2-DX2/
AIMP2 expression ratio may differ for each cancer type. Indeed, a
previous report demonstrated that AIMP2-DX2 inversely corre-
lated with the survival of lung cancer patients7. Therefore, further
studies validating the prognostic signiﬁcance of AIMP2-DX2 and
optimizing its cutoff value in various cancers are necessary.

The presence of AIMP2-DX2 provides important insights into
tumorigenesis and the progression of cancers. However, detailed
studies have not been reported concerning how to detect AIMP2-
DX2. Although direct sequencing has been widely used for
detecting mutations, it is labor-intensive and time-consuming for
routine clinical analysis34. In the present study, we developed an
image-based analysis that can quantitate the AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2
mRNA expression ratio at the single-cell level. In addition, tar-
geted RNA-sequencing was applied for quantifying levels of
AIMP2 and AIMP2-DX2 mRNAs. Together,
these methods
provide a rapid and highly accurate approach for quantifying the
expression ratio of AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2. However, because
almost every cancer patient displayed a nonzero AIMP2-DX2/
AIMP2 expression ratio, the optimal cutoff value needs to be
determined for deﬁning AIMP2-DX2 positivity, as is the case for
the her2/cep17 ratio in breast cancer35. With a comprehensive
understanding of the role of AIMP2-DX2, various diagnostic
methods for detecting AIMP2-DX2 are currently under the
development.

Genomics Hub of the sequencing programs of the National Cancer Institute, using
GeneTorrent37. Expression levels of AIMP2 and AIMP2-DX2 mRNAs for each
sample were estimated as described in the targeted RNA-sequencing section.
HTSeq-count, open-source software for the analysis of high-throughput sequen-
cing data, was used to count whole RNA-sequencing reads for differential
expression analysis, as described in the next section38.

Differentially expressed gene set analysis. After processing with HTSeq-count,
the RNA-sequencing data of the ICGC/TCGA database were analyzed for DEG set
analysis. DEGs by AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 expression ratio were identiﬁed using an R
package, DESeq239, and then were utilized to identify differentially regulated
pathways (or gene sets) using another R package, gage40. Candidate genes involved
in each canonical pathway were taken from the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomics) pathway database (Release 79.1, September 2016)41. Among
various pathways, the analysis was focused on the ten major cancer pathways.

Statistics and reproducibility. The negative binomial generalized linear model
was applied for identifying genes differentially expressed by AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2
expression ratio39. DEG set analysis was carried out by using the GAGE method40,
and the test statistics across samples were summarized at a pathway level with an
FDR q value. Because tumorigenesis is controlled by AIMP2 in a dosage-dependent
manner3, and AIMP2-DX2 competitively inhibits the activity of AIMP2, the
AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 expression ratio was assumed to affect the expression of gene
sets in a dose-dependent manner. Accordingly, the AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 expres-
sion ratio was considered as a continuous variable in the DEG set analysis. Dif-
ferences in continuous variables between two groups in a clinical validation cohort
were analyzed by the unpaired t test or the Mann–Whitney U test, if appropriate.
Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan–Meier method and compared
using a log-rank test. The Cox proportional hazard regression model was applied to
determine the HR for AIMP2-DX2 positivity with respect to OS and PFS. For all
statistical analyses, P values < 0.05 or FDR q values < 0.10 were considered statis-
tically signiﬁcant. All statistical analyses were carried out using R version 3.3.1
(http://www.r-project.org). For cell studies, statistical analysis was performed with
the Microsoft Excel 2016 software. Statistical signiﬁcance was determined by using
one-tailed t test with unequal variance. All data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. as
indicated in the ﬁgure legends. P value < 0.05 was considered as statistically sig-
niﬁcant (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001). The sample size n is presented in the
ﬁgure legends.

Analysis of the AML clinical patient cohort. A total of 51 adult AML patients,
who agreed to donate bone marrow samples for research after giving informed
consent, were included in the clinical validation cohort. Bone marrow samples of
these patients at the time of diagnosis were collected using PAXgene Blood RNA
tubes (PreAnalytiX, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland). The AIMP2 and AIMP2-DX2
mRNA levels were assessed by RT-PCR. Patients were divided into two groups
according to the positivity of AIMP2-DX2. The diagnosis of AML was based on the
WHO criteria, and AML was classiﬁed according to the FAB classiﬁcation system.
Patients were stratiﬁed into three risk groups based on cytogenetic and molecular
analyses of bone marrow samples according to the reﬁned MRC criteria42. Data
regarding patient demographics and survival outcomes were obtained by a review
of medical records. OS was deﬁned as the duration from diagnosis to death from
any cause, and PFS was deﬁned as the time from diagnosis until relapse or death
from any cause. Patients who were alive were censored at the date of the last
contact. This protocol was approved by the Seoul National University Hospital
Institutional Review Board (IRB approval number: 1201-099-396). This study was
conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki provisions.

RT-PCR for detecting AIMP2 and AIMP2-DX2 expression. The cDNA EcoDry
Premix (Clontech laboratories, Mountain View, CA, USA) was used to convert
RNAs to cDNAs, following the manufacturer’s recommendations. The primer pairs
were designed for full-length AIMP2 and AIMP2-DX2, separately. For full-length
AIMP2, the forward primer was designed to target the splicing junction between
exons 1 and 2, while the forward primer for AIMP2-DX2 was designed to target the
splicing junction between exons 1 and 3, skipping exon 2. A common reverse
primer targeting exon 3 of the AIMP2 was used. In addition, one more primer pair
was designed to target exons 1 and 3 to amplify both full-length AIMP2 (1078 bp)
and AIMP2-DX2 (871 bp). Primer sequences for RT-PCR used in this study are
provided in Supplementary Table 3.

Targeted RNA-sequencing for AIMP2 and AIMP2-DX2. Targeted RNA-
sequencing was performed using the Ion AmpliSeq targeting the AIMP2 gene.
Library construction was performed using the Ion AmpliSeq Library Kit 2.0 (Life
Technologies, Waltham, MA, USA), and library templates were prepared and
barcoded for sequencing using the Ion OneTouch System, as per manufacturer’s
instructions. Sequencing reads were processed using the Ion Torrent Suite Software
v 4.0.2 (Life Technologies). Demultiplexed samples were assessed for sequencing
quality, and high-quality reads were mapped to the complete hg19 human genome
(UCSC version, February 2009). Expression levels of full-length AIMP2 and
AIMP2-DX2 mRNAs were estimated by samtools43. Reads having junctions

between exons 1 and 2 (chr7:6009499-6015145) were deﬁned as the full-length
AIMP2, while those having junctions between exons 1 and 3 (chr7:6009499-
6017814) were deﬁned as AIMP2-DX2. In terms of a CIGAR string, reads corre-
sponding to AIMP2-DX2 had a longer length of skipped lesion than those of wild-
type AIMP2.

Cell lines. Seventeen cancer cell lines were cultured under recommended condi-
tions (Supplementary Table 4) in a 37 °C and 5% CO2 humidiﬁed incubator. Cell
lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas,
VA, USA), Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (GmbH,
Braunschweig, Germany), and Korean Cell Line Bank (Seoul, Korea). SNU-536MM
was internally established at Seoul National University Hospital using a bone
marrow sample of multiple myeloma patients. Each culture media (Welgene Inc.,
Daegu, Korea) was supplemented with heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, peni-
cillin/streptomycin, sodium pyruvate, and L-glutamine (GIBCO; Grand Island, NY,
USA). All of the suspension and adherent cells were cultured and stabilized at least
for 24 h before using them for experiments. All cell lines were authenticated by
short tandem repeat (STR) proﬁling and were tested regularly for mycoplasma
contamination. According to the International Cell Line Authentication Com-
mittee register (https://iclac.org/), cross contamination has been reported in HS-
Sultan cells where no authentic stock is known. We used HS-Sultan cell line
authenticated by ATCC, using STR proﬁling analysis.

Sample preparation and RNA extraction. In order to assess the plausibility of an
AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 expression ratio for determining AIMP2-DX2 positivity,
targeted RNA-sequencing was performed in 16 cancer cell lines (Supplementary
Table 2). The RNAs of these cancer cell lines were isolated using TRIzol reagent
(Life Technologies, Waltham, MA, USA) with 1 mL TRIzol, 200 μL chloroform,
500 μL isopropanol, and 1 mL 75% ethanol in accordance with manufacturer’s
instructions.

Nucleic acid probes. ISH probes for AIMP2 were designed and purchased from
Advanced Cell Diagnostics. RNAscope probe Hs-AIMP2-E2 (cat. no. 444981)
targets exon 2 of AIMP2, while Hs-AIMP2-E1E3E4 (cat. no. 451471) targets exons
1, 3, and 4 of AIMP2 and AIMP2-DX2 mRNAs. These two probes were labeled
with C1 and C2, respectively, and the multiplex detection kit was used to visualize
them simultaneously.

RNA-smFISH. RNA-smFISH was performed according to the RNAscope Multi-
plex Fluorescent Assay (ACD, Inc., Hayward, California, USA) protocol with an
additional step to attach suspension cells on to a microscope slide. Cells were
washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde
(Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatﬁeld, PA, USA) for 1 h at room temperature.
Fixed cells were washed two times with PBS, and resuspended with 70% EtOH and
kept overnight at 4 °C to permeabilize. Cells were spread on a microscope slide and
attached on to the slide by drying it at room temperature for 40 min. This step was
omitted when adherent cells were used. Cells were then dehydrated by a sub-
sequent wash with 50, 70, and 100% EtOH. Dehydrated cells were treated with
Protease K (RNAscope® pre-treat kit, cat. No.322330) for 30 min at 40 °C. Cells
were then hybridized with AIMP2 probes (cat. no. 444981 and 451474) for 2 h at
40 °C. Subsequent signal ampliﬁcation steps were performed by treating cells with
AMP1-FL, AMP2-FL, AMP3-FL, and AMP4-FL reagents of the RNAscope
detection kit (cat. no. 323382). Cells were incubated in the DAPI solution for 1 min
at room temperature to counterstain the nuclei. Mounting solution (Vector Labs,
California, USA) was applied, and Zeiss confocal microscope (LSM780; Carl Zeiss
Microscopy, GmbH, Germany) with a 40× objective (NA = 1.20) was used for
imaging.

RNA-smFISH image analysis. RNA-smFISH images were analyzed with a pro-
gram coded using MATLAB (Math Works, Natick, MA, USA) v2014b image
processing tool. Images were split into two single color channels (red and green)
using an intensity threshold, and the two-channel images were analyzed simulta-
neously. The noise was identiﬁed based on the object size and removed from the
image. Individual objects from the two channels were identiﬁed, and their pixel
areas were measured. The ratio of red/green, which reﬂects the expression ratio of
AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2, was calculated by dividing the average pixel areas from the
red channel to that of the green channel, as shown below:

labeled as a nucleus. Red or green signals were assigned to the nearest nucleus
based on the distance to the center of each nucleus. The red-to-green ratio was
calculated by dividing the pixel area from the red channel to that of the green
channel for every cell.

Transfection. siRNAs were transfected to adherent cells using Lipofectamine 3000
(Life Technologies, MA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. For sus-
pension cells, the Neon electroporation system (1350 V, 35 ms, once for HL-60;
1350 V, 20 ms, twice for Namalwa; 1050 V, 30 ms, once for KMS-12-BM; 1100 V,
20 ms, once for ML-1) was used. siRNAs were purchased from Bioneer Korea Inc.
or Genolution, and their sequences are provided in Supplementary Table 5.

qPCR for the gene expression analysis. For qPCR, puriﬁed RNA was treated
with DNase I (Takara) and reverse-transcribed using RevertAid reverse tran-
scriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) with random hexamer primers. Synthesized
cDNA was ampliﬁed by SensiFAST SYBR Lo-Rox Kit (Bioline) and analyzed.
Primers used in this study are provided in Supplementary Table 3.

Western blotting. Total cell lysates were prepared by sonication in the lysis buffer
(50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM KCl, 0.5% NP-40, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM DTT)
supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail III (Calbiochem) and phosphatase
inhibitor cocktail I (AG Scientiﬁc). A total of 30–50 μg of protein sample was sepa-
rated on an SDS–PAGE gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane using the
Amersham semidry transfer system. Primary antibodies used in this study are: AIMP2
(Biocon, BC-02-14), AIMP2-DX2 (Creative Biolabs, HPAB-M0004-YC), GAPDH
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-32233), and following antibodies were purchased from
Cell Signaling Technology: p-p53 (9284 T), PUMA (12450 T), and TUBB (86298 S).
All antibodies were used with 1:1000 dilution except for AIMP2 and AIMP2-DX2,
which were used with 1:500 dilution and 1:15000 dilution, respectively.

Cell viability. MTT assay was performed to measure the cell viability. A total of 100
µL of cell suspension was transferred into a 96-well plate. A total of 20 µL of MTT
solution (5 mg/mL in PBS, ﬁltered) was added, and cells were incubated for 3.5 h at
37 °C in a humidiﬁed 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at
1500 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was carefully removed. Cells were resus-
pended in 100 µL of dimethylsulfoxide. The absorbance was measured at 545 nm
using a Varioskan Lux microplate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc).
