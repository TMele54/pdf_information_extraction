Abstract 

Aminoacyl-tRNA  synthetase-interacting  multi-functional  protein  2  (AIMP2)  works  as  potent 
tumor suppressor, while its splicing variant lacking exon 2 (AIMP2-DX2) competes with AIMP2 for 
binding to target proteins and compromises its anti-tumor activity. Assuming that AIMP2 and its 
variant AIMP2-DX2 could be released out to human sera in pathological condition, we investigated 
the  diagnostic  and  prognostic  usefulness  of  autoantibodies  against  AIMP2  and  AIMP2-DX2  by 
measuring their serum levels  in 80 normal and lung cancer samples that were matched  in age, 
gender  and  smoking  status.  The  area  under  the  curve  of  AIMP2-DX2,  AIMP2,  and 
AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 autoantibody ratio was low (0.416, 0.579, and 0.357, respectively), suggesting 
limited  diagnostic  value.  A  total  of  165  lung  cancer  patients  were  classified  into  low  and  high 
AIMP2-DX2, AIMP2, and AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 based on the median expression of each parameter. 
The high AIMP2-DX2 group was older and had larger tumors (>3 cm) than the low AIMP2-DX2 
group. The high AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 group had higher CYFRA-21 levels and significantly shorter 
overall survival than the low AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 group (18.6 vs. 48.9 months, P = 0.021, Log Rank 
Test). Taken together, autoantibodies against AIMP2-DX2 and AIMP2 are detectable in the human 
blood and the increased ratio of AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 is related to poor clinical outcome of lung 
cancer.

Introduction 

Lung  cancer 

is  the  second  most  common 
malignancy, accounting for more than one-quarter of 
all  cancer  deaths  in  the  United  States.[1]  Despite  the 
unremitting  efforts  toward  biomarker  discovery  and 
the  development 
and 
immunotherapy,  lung  cancer  is  by  far  the  leading 
cause  of  cancer  death  with  poor  prognosis. 
Development of effective tools for early diagnosis and 

targeted 

therapy 

of 

new  therapeutic  strategies  based  on  lung  cancer 
biology  are  urgently  needed  to  improve  its  clinical 
outcome. 

Aminoacyl-tRNA  synthetase-interacting  multi- 
functional  proteins  (AIMPs)  are  scaffolding  proteins 
for  the  assembly  of  the  macromolecular  tRNA 
synthetase  complex.  Among  the  3  types  of  AIMPs, 
AIMP2  (also  known  as  p38  and  JTV1)  possesses

anti-proliferative  and  cell  death-promoting  activity 
through  multiple  pathways  such  as  tumor-derived 
growth  factor  (TGF)-β,  p53,  tumor  necrosis  factor 
(TNF)-α  signaling  and  Wnt  signaling.[2-8]  Mice 
lacking  AIMP2  die  neonatally  due  to  respiratory 
failure  resulting  from  uncontrolled  proliferation  of 
lung epithelial cells. AIMP2 heterozygous mice (with 
reduced  expression  of  AIMP2)  show  a  higher 
susceptibility  to  tumorigenesis.[5]  These  findings 
indicate  that  AIMP2  is  a  haploinsufficient  tumor 
suppressor with a unique working mechanism.[2]  

A variant of AIMP2 in which exon 2 is deleted by 
alternative splicing, AIMP2-DX2, has been detected in 
cancer cell lines and tissues.[9] AIMP2-DX2 competes 
with AIMP2 for the binding to target proteins (namely 
FUSE-binding protein [FBP], TNF receptor-associated 
factor  2  [TRAF2],  and  p53),  consequently  inhibiting 
the  tumor  suppressive  activity  of  AIMP2.  Increased 
ratio  of  AIMP2-DX2  versus  AIMP2  showed  positive 
correlation to poor clinical outcome of lung cancer, as 
well  as  chemoresistance  of  ovarian  cancer.[2,  9]  The 
the 
synthetic 
AIMP2-DX2  mRNA 
the 
inhibition  of  the  AIMP2-DX2  activity  and  tumor 
suppression.[10]  Taken  together,  these  data  suggest 
that AIMP2-DX2 is an attractive candidate for cancer 
diagnosis and therapy.

In  this  study,  AIMP2-DX2  expression  was 
examined  in  lung  cancer  using  Kras  and  Kras:p53fl/fl 
mouse  lung  cancer  models  and  human  lung  cancer 
tissues.  Moreover,  the  presence  of  autoantibodies 
against  AIMP2-DX2  and  AIMP2  in  the  blood  was 
investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA).  We  sought  to  find  the  diagnostic  and 
prognostic usefulness of these autoantibodies in lung 
cancer patients. 

Materials and Methods 

Tissue samples 

LSL-Kras 

G12D:p53fl/fl 

Mouse  tissues  were  obtained  from  wild-type 
C57BL/6, LSL-Kras G12D, and LSL-Kras G12D:p53fl/fl 
mice. For mouse lung cancer tissues, LSL-Kras G12D 
mice 
and 
(http://mouse.ncifcrf.gov/)  inhaled  5  ×  107  PFU 
AdCre particles at 8 weeks of age and sacrificed at 8 
and  24  weeks  after  inhalation,  respectively.  This 
animal  study  was  approved  by  our  Institutional 
Animal  Care  and  Use  Committee  (2014-0229-1), 
following the guidelines of the American Association 
for  the  Assessment  and  Accreditation  of  Laboratory 
Animal  Care.  A 
formalin-fixed, 
paraffin-embedded human lung cancer tissues, and 12 
pairs  of  lung  cancer  and  adjacent  normal-appearing 
lung tissue lysates were obtained from tissue archives 

total  of  275 

of affiliated hospitals of Yonsei University College of 
Medicine.  The  use  of  clinical  samples  was  approved 
by  the  Institutional  Review  Board  of  the  Severance 
Hospital  (#4-2013-0556)  and  Gangnam  Severance 
Hospital (#3-2014-0838). 

Serum samples 

cancer 

cases  were 

The  serum  samples  from  lung  cancer  patients 
and  control  subjects  were  obtained  from  those  who 
had  presented  to  Severance  Hospital  and  Gangnam 
Severance Hospital between 2011 September and 2015 
January.  Lung 
confirmed 
pathologically  and  did  not  present  with  any  other 
types  of  cancer.  Control  cases  were  1:1  age-,  gender- 
and smoking status-matched and did not present with 
any type of cancer. A total of 165 samples from lung 
cancer patients were included. Informed consent was 
obtained  from  all  study  subjects,  and  all  protocols 
were  approved  by  the  Institutional  Review  Board  of 
the Severance Hospital (#4-2013-0556) and Gangnam 
Severance  Hospital  (#3-2014-0838).  The  study  was 
carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  Declaration  of 
Helsinki and Korean GCP guidelines. 

Immunoblotting 

Tissues were harvested using 2× LSB lysis buffer 
inhibitors 
containing  protease  and  phosphatase 
(GenDepo,  Korea)  on  ice.  After  homogenization  and 
sonication,  30–50 mg  of  lysates  was  separated  by  gel 
electrophoresis  on  7.5–12%  polyacrylamide  gels  and 
transferred  onto  nitrocellulose  membranes  (Bio-Rad 
Laboratories, 
Inc.,  Richmond,  CA,  USA).  The 
expression level of each protein was measured using 
Image  J  (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/)  and  quantified 
relative to that of β-actin. 

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) 

Expression of AIMP2-DX2 in mouse lung tissue 
and  human  lung  cancer  tissue  was  analyzed  by  IHC 
using  the  LABS®2  System  (Dako,  Carpinteria,  CA, 
USA)  according  to  the  manufacturer’s  instructions. 
Briefly,  sections  were  deparaffinized,  rehydrated, 
immersed  in  H2O2  methanol  solution,  and  then 
incubated overnight with  primary antibodies against 
AIMP2-DX2  obtained  by  rabbit  immunization  at  a 
1:2,000  dilution.  Sections  were  incubated  for  10 
minutes with biotinylated linker and processed using 
3,3 ′
avidin/biotin 
-Diaminobenzidine  (DAB)  was  used  as  a  chromogen 
in  conjunction  with  the  Liquid  DAB  Substrate  kit 
(Novacastra,  UK).  Expression  of  AIMP2-DX2  was 
evaluated  using  a  scoring  system  that  takes  into 
account 
intensity  and 
percentage  of  positive  cells.  Staining  intensity  was 
classified as 0, 1, 2, and 3 and frequency was classified

as 0 (<10%), 1 (10–50%), 2 (51–80%), and 3 (>80%) (Fig. 
S1). The cases were classified into 2 groups according 
to  the  AIMP2-DX2  expression  in  the  cytoplasm  and 
nucleus.  Cases  with 
cytoplasmic  AIMP2-DX2 
expression intensity and frequency equal to or greater 
than 4 were defined as having high expression; those 
with 3 or less were defined as having low expression. 
Cases with nuclear AIMP2-DX2 expression equal to or 
greater 
than  1  were  defined  as  having  high 
expression; those with 0 were defined as having low 
expression. 

Measurement of serum autoantibodies against 
AIMP2 and AIMP2-DX2 

The  96-well  plates  were  coated  with  either 
His-tagged AIMP2-DX2 or His-tagged AIMP2 protein 
(Neomix  Inc,  Korea)  overnight  at  4°C,  and  then 
blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 hour at 
room temperature. After adding 1:500 diluted serum, 
1:10,000 dilution anti-human immunoglobulin G was 
added  and  incubated  for  another  1  hour  at  room 
temperature.  The  enzyme  activity  was  visualized  by 
adding  3,3′,  5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine 
substrate 
(TMB;  Thermo  Fisher  Scientific)  for  10  minutes  and 
the  reaction  was  stopped  by  2N  H2SO4.  The 
absorbance  was  measured  at  450  nm  was  measured. 
The  intra-assay  variation  of  AIMP2-DX2  and  AIMP2 
was  8.7% 
(1.6–10.4%), 
(6.8–11.5%)  and  6.3% 
respectively. The inter-assay (plate-to-plate) variation 
was  15.9%  (13.7–17.9%)  and  12.2%  (8.9–16.1%), 
respectively. Lung cancer patients were classified into 
2  groups,  high  and  low,  on  the  basis  of  the  median 
values 
and 
of 
AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 ratio.

non-neoplastic lung tissue from 8-week-old wild-type 
to 
C57BL/6  mice  using 
AIMP2-DX2  (Fig.  S2A).  Cells  comprising  alveolar 
structure  did  not  express  AIMP2-DX2,  while 
bronchial epithelial cells showed weak expression. To 
evaluate if AIMP2-DX2 expression is specific to lung 
cancer,  its  expression  was  evaluated  in  lung  cancer 
tissues. 
AIMP2-DX2 
overexpression  was  observed  in  Kras-LSL  G12D  and 
Kras-LSL  G12D:p53fl/fl  murine  lung  cancer  models 
induced  by  AdCre 
(Fig.  S2B).  The 
expression  of  AIMP2-DX2  was  also  evaluated  in 
normal-appearing  human  tissues  adjacent  to  lung 
cancer  tissues  (Fig.  S2C).  AIMP2-DX2  was  not 
expressed in type I and type II pneumocytes and was 
weakly  expressed  in  the  epithelial  cells  of  the 
bronchioles  and  bronchi.  In  human  lung  cancer 
tissues, AIMP2-DX2 was strongly expressed mainly in 
the  cytoplasm  of  adenocarcinoma,  squamous  cell 
carcinoma,  and  small  cell  lung  cancer,  and  weakly 
expressed  in  large  cell  carcinoma  (Fig.  S2D).  Lung 
cancer-specific  AIMP2-DX2  overexpression  was 
further evaluated by immunoblotting. In mouse lung 
tissue,  AIMP2-DX2  expression  was  stronger  in  lung 
cancer  than  in  normal  lungs  (Fig.  S2E).  Among  12 
pairs  of  human  lung  cancer  tissue  and  adjacent 
normal-appearing lung tissue, 7 pairs (58.3%) showed 
stronger overexpression of AIMP2-DX2 in lung cancer 
tissue  (Fig.  S2F).  To  further  validate  its  clinical 
its  expression  was 
implication 
assessed  in  275  formalin-fixed,  paraffin-embedded 
lung cancer tissues. The baseline characteristics of the 
275 patients are shown in Table S1. The distribution of 
cytoplasmic  and  nuclear  AIMP2-DX2  expression  by 
IHC  is  shown  in  Fig.  S2G  and  S2H.  Among  the  275 
patients,  270  (98.2%)  showed  positive  cytoplasmic 
AIMP2-DX2  expression  while  91  (33.1%)  showed 
positive  nuclear  AIMP2-DX2  expression.  The  clinical 
and pathological characteristics of patients with high 
and low cytoplasmic/nuclear expression are shown in 
Table  S2.  High  cytoplasmic  (39.6%  vs.  28.6%,  P  = 
0.055) and nuclear AIMP2-DX2 expression (42.9% vs. 
30.4%,  P  =  0.042)  was  more  frequent  in  advanced 
stages  (III–IV)  than  in  earlier  stages  (I–II).  High 
cytoplasmic (58.2% vs. 40.2%, P = 0.003) and nuclear 
AIMP2-DX2  expression  (58.4%  vs.  45.8%,  P  =  0.052) 
in 
was  more  frequent

AIMP2-DX2  expression  was  not  related  with  clinical 
outcome,  with  no  significant  differences  in  OS  and

patients are shown in Table 2. Mean age was 65 years 
and 64.8% of the patients were male. About one-third 
of  the  patients  were  never-smokers.  According  to 
histologic  classification,  adenocarcinoma  was  the 
most  common  type  (62.4%),  followed  by  squamous

Elevated AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 autoantibody 
ratio is related with poor clinical outcome in 
lung cancer 

To evaluate the prognostic value of AIMP2-DX2, 
AIMP2,  and  AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2  autoantibody  ratio 
in  lung  cancer,  OS  and  PFS  were  compared  using 
Kaplan–Meier  estimators  (Fig.  2).  There  were  no 
significant  differences  in  PFS  and  OS  between  low 
and  high  AIMP2-DX2  and  AIMP2  autoantibody 
high 
groups.  However, 
AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2  autoantibody 
ratio  showed 
significantly shorter OS (18.4 months [95% confidence 
interval  (CI)  15.1–21.7]  vs.  48.3  months  [95%  CI 
14.6–81.9], P = 0.021). To evaluate the hypothesis that 
high  AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2  ratio  is  an  independent 
prognostic  factor  in  lung  cancer,  univariate  and 

the  patients  with

autoantibody  ratio  were  significant  predictors  for 
poor  OS  while  adenocarcinoma  histology  was  a

Discussion

This  study  investigated  the  clinical  implications 
of  AIMP2-DX2 
serum 
autoantibodies  in  lung  cancer  patients.  Although 
AIMP2-DX2  was  frequently  overexpressed  in  lung 
cancer tissues, and associated with  advanced disease 
stages  and  adenocarcinoma,  diagnostic  usefulness  of 
AIMP2-DX2 
limited. 
Autoantibodies against AIMP2-DX2 and AIMP2 exist 
at  detectable  level  in  human  blood  and  increased

with lung cancer.

Although  several  reports  have  suggested  the 
tumor  promoting  role  of  AIMP2-DX2,  a  potential  of 
AIMP2-DX2  as  a  biomarker  for  cancer  diagnosis, 
treatment, and prognosis prediction is limited.[2-7] In 
this  study,  we  used  immunohistological  analysis 
using  AIMP2-DX2-specific  antibody 
to  directly 
monitor  AIMP2-DX2  at  protein  level  rather  than  its 
transcript  level  and  found  its  frequent  increase 
(54.2%) in NSCLC tissues.  

There are pressing needs for the development of 
blood  biomarkers  because  it  is  convenient  and  less 
invasive. There are a few biomarkers for the diagnosis 
and  prognosis  prediction  in  lung  cancer  and  their 
usefulness is hampered because of low diagnostic and 
prognostic  value.[11-13]  Although  it  was  unclear

Although  this  study  presented  a  potential  of 
AIMP2-DX2  as  a  potential  biomarker  in  lung  cancer, 
there are a few limitations to be addressed. First, the 
diagnostic  and  prognostic  value  of  AIMP2-DX2  as 
determined by IHC and autoantibody levels needs to 
be compared in the specimens obtained from the same 
subjects  at  the  same  time  point.  The  relationship 
between AIMP2-DX2 in the tissue and in the blood is 
role  of 
important 
AIMP2-DX2  in  cancer  formation  and  progression. 
Second,  development  of  direct  measurement  of 
AIMP2-DX2  and  AIMP2  in  the  blood  would  be  also 
needed  to  overcome  the  limitation  of  autoantibody 
analysis. Future studies should compare the secretory 
form  of  AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2  and  autoantibodies 
against AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 as suitable biomarkers in 
lung  cancer.  In  conclusion,  autoantibodies  against 
AIMP2-DX2 and AIMP2 were detectable in blood. The 
increased ratio of AIMP2-DX2/AIMP2 autoantibodies 
was  related  to  the  poor  clinical  outcome  of  lung 
its  potential  as  a 
cancer  patients,  suggesting 
prognostic marker in lung cancer.
